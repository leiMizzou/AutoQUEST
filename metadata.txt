Device Name in "foiclass" Table
The Device Name uses the format of a noun that is usually followed by one or more adjectives, separated by commas. Therefore, the first word in the device name is usually the best search parameter. For example, to find a specific pump, search on the word "pump" to retrieve all products with the word "pump" in their name.

-------------------------------

Device Class in "foiclass" Table
Device Class refers to the level of CDRH regulation of a given device. For each device, the applicable Medical Specialty panel recommends to CDRH the appropriate device class. The three Class designations are:

Class 1 - Devices subject to General Controls,
Class 2 - Devices subject to General Controls and Special Controls,
Class 3 - Devices subject to General Controls, Special Controls, and Premarket Clearance
Further information on how devices are classified.

------------------------------

Each year, the FDA receives over two million medical device reports of suspected device-associated deaths, serious injuries, and malfunctions. These medical device reports have been available in the FDA's public Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) Database since 1999 as one source of information to help patients and health care providers make more informed medical decisions.

On this page, the FDA is also providing the medical device reports received from 1984 - 1996 through CDRH's legacy Device Experience Network (DEN) reporting system and reports received under the Alternative Summary Reporting Program from 1999 – April 2019.

Under the Freedom of Information and Privacy Acts (Sec. 552, Title 5, USC) (PL 93-579), the FDA is required to delete, prior to public disclosure, any information that constitutes trade secrets, and confidential, commercial, or financial information; and any personal, medical, and similar information that would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. Included in the deletion requirements are all identification of the reporters of the events and the user facility where the event occurred.

MAUDE Data Downloadable Files
This section provides downloadable zipped data files that consist of:

Voluntary reports since June 1993
User facility reports since 1991
Distributor reports since 1993
Manufacturer reports since August 1996
This data is provided in zip files, which are updated monthly.

The MDR data is presented in tables and contains all publicly available information from the completed the MEDWATCH Form 3500. The FDA recommends downloading all types of files for the time period of interest.

Tip for Downloading Files
When downloading the MDR data files to a database such as Microsoft Access, we recommend that you first open, then save the data file in Microsoft WORD. This will add an "end of record" marker to each MDR record that can be recognized by Microsoft ACCESS. For files such as the FOIDEV files, you may need to put in an extra character at the end of the first record prior to importing the file, otherwise the last column of data may be lost.
Tips for Reviewing the Downloaded Files
Field Definitions:
Master Event Data: A distinct master event data record will be present for each source reporting an event. In other words, if a User Facility, Distributor, Manufacturer, and voluntary submitter all report an event, there will be four event records.
Device Data: Contains information related to the device(s) involved in the event.
Patient Data: Contains information related to the patient(s) involved in the event.
Text Data: Contains textual information from MEDWATCH Form Sections B5, H3, and H10.
Device Problem Data: Contains Device Problem Code data from MEDWATCH Form Sections F10 and H6
Patient Problem Data: Contains Health Effect – Clinical Code (previously labeled "Patient Code") data from MEDWATCH Form Sections F10 and H6
All record types are linked by the MDR REPORT KEY, found in each file.
For distributor reports that also had subsequent manufacturer reports, a special data element, MANUFACTURER LINK FLAG, will be set to 'Y'. In this case, the DISTRIBUTOR information (Section F on the master event data record) will be present; otherwise, these data elements will be blank.

Alternative Summary Reports
On February 18, 2022, the FDA posted the available Patient Problem Codes associated with legacy Alternative Summary Report (ASR) files on FDA.gov. The 2022 update followed the addition of Patient Problem Codes to the public Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database in September 2020 to provide additional information on the nature of adverse events and related devices, when available.

The Alternative Summary Reporting (ASR) Program was in effect from 1997 through June 2019. In June 2019, the FDA formally ended the Alternative Summary Reporting (ASR) Program and revoked all such exemptions. All reports received under ASR exemptions from 1999 to April 2019 (when the FDA last received reports under the ASR program) are available in the legacy data files linked below. Reports received under the ASR Program from 1999 – April 2019 are not available in MAUDE and are therefore provided on this page.

For more information, see the 2019 Statement on agency's efforts to increase transparency in medical device reporting.


By law, manufacturers may request exemptions, variances or alternatives to reporting requirements under 21 CFR 803.19. Under this provision, the FDA had allowed alternative summary reports (ASRs) for specific well-known and well-characterized events associated with specific devices.

It is important to note that data in ASRs are subject to the same limitations as MDR data in the MAUDE database; they are based on the same threshold for reporting and differ in format. This passive reporting system relies on information provided by users of the devices and other sources, and therefore some information about certain events may be missing, inaccurate, or unverified. Manufacturers are responsible for following up to obtain missing information, but it is not always possible to track down details of an event. Therefore, some fields in both the MAUDE database and ASR reports may be blank. Like all MDR data in the MAUDE database, MDR data in ASR reports cannot be used to determine rates of adverse events due to under-reporting of events, inaccuracies in reports, lack of verification that the device caused the reported event, and lack of information about frequency of device use. In addition, the number of events may fluctuate over time for a variety of reasons that do not reflect a change in the actual rate of the events, such as changes in technology that impact rate of use in clinical practice, changes in a firm's reporting processes, and following a public communication or media reports about a technology. Moreover, the presence of an event or multiple events does not necessarily mean there is a problem with a device. Often additional investigation and data collection are necessary to make that determination.

ASR exemptions excluded events where the device may have caused or contributed to a patient death from being submitted in ASRs, except for sudden death associated with cardiac arrest for certain surgical heart valves when the device had been implanted for at least five years and the event did not necessitate remedial action to prevent an unreasonable risk of substantial harm to the public health.

When an ineligible event was reported through an ASR, the FDA's standard practice was to contact the manufacturer to obtain additional information regarding the event. If the event was labeled in error, the manufacturer was asked to submit a supplemental ASR to correct it. If an event was ineligible for reporting as an ASR, the FDA's standard practice was to require the manufacturer to submit an individual report in MAUDE for the event. In some cases, the FDA revoked ASR exemptions following continued reporting of ineligible events in ASRs.

In some cases, manufacturers also submitted supplemental ASRs providing additional information, such as following an investigation into an event. The supplemental ASRs may include only new information; fields where information did not change from the original ASR may be blank. Both original and supplemental ASRs are posted on our website. Supplemental reports are identified, and caution should be taken so as not to count the same events twice when they appear in both a supplemental and original report.

ASR reports were not made publicly available before 2019 because they were not submitted in a format compatible with the public MAUDE database. The FDA recognized the public interest in this information and modified the conditions of the ASR Program in 2017 to require submission of a companion report on the official mandatory reporting form. The companion report included the total number of events being summarized in the quarterly report through the ASR Program and is available publicly in the MAUDE database. When both an ASR and companion report were submitted, the same events were captured in both systems. Therefore, adding events from ASR and companion reports will result in some double counting.

The following files contain ASR data by reporting year, comprising over six million records in total. Each file is large and contains all ASRs received for that year. As such, these are compressed data files using the zip format. After files are downloaded, they should be unzipped. The unzipped .CSV files can be viewed with a spreadsheet or database software. The ASR data has one record per line, with the data fields in the following comma-delimited format:

Exemption Number,Manufacturer Registration Number,Manufacturer Name,Report ID,Date of Event,Manufacturer Aware Date,Event Type,Device Problem Codes,Report Year,Report Quarter,Initial Report Flag,Device ID,Product Code,Brand Name,Model Number,Catalog Number,Implant Available for Evaluation,Implant Returned to Manufacturer

Following are the compressed MDR data files received from Alternative Summary Reports listed with their compressed and uncompressed file sizes for each year. The data for each year is sorted by product code, exemption number, and quarter.

In February 2022, the FDA added an addendum file containing the Patient Problem Codes for all years of legacy ASR data (1999-2019). The Patient Problem Code records contained in the ASR_PPC file have a one-to-one mapping with the records in the ASR yearly files, based on the Exemption Number, Report ID, Product Code, Report Year, and Report Quarter columns. The ASR_PPC zip file has the same format as the yearly ASR files, with the data fields in the following comma-delimited format: Exemption Number, Report ID, Product Code, Report Year, Report Quarter, Patient Problem Codes. Due to the large size, the addendum file should be opened in database software, such as Microsoft Access, along with the ASR yearly files. This update followed the addition of patient problem codes to the public MAUDE database in September 2020 to provide additional information on the nature of adverse events and related devices, when available.

Device Experience Network (DEN) Reports
CDRH's Device Experience Network (DEN) was used by the FDA from 1984 – 1996 to store file reports received under both the mandatory Medical Device Reporting Program (MDR) from 1984 - 1996, and the voluntary reports up to June 1993. These files contain over 600,000 reports.

An on-line search is available which allows you to search for information on medical devices which may have malfunctioned or caused a death or serious injury during the years 1984 through 1996.

The following files contain DEN data listed by the year they were received. Each file is large, and complete for that year. As such, these are compressed data files using the zip format. After files are downloaded, they should be unzipped. The unzipped .TXT files can be viewed with a text editor, spreadsheet or database software. The MDR data has one record per line, with the data fields in the following pipe-delimited, (i.e., "|") format:

Access Type and Number|Date Received|Product Description|Manufacturer name code|Manufacturer Name|Street address|City|State
|Zipcode|Report type|Model number|Catalog number| FDA panel code|FDA Product code|Event description type|Event description|Closeout text

Following are the compressed MDR data files received from CDRH's DEN reports listed with their compressed and uncompressed file sizes. The last file listed, disclaim.zip, contains a disclaimer from the manufacturer for each report.
