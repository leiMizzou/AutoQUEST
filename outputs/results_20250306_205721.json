  "research_question": "## Proposed Medical Device/Drug Safety Research Question and Strategy\n\nBased on the provided healthcare database table information, a meaningful medical device/drug safety research question could be:\n\n**Research Question:**\n\n**\"Is there a difference in the reported adverse reaction profiles (types and frequencies) between homeopathic drugs and non-homeopathic drugs, as evidenced by data within this database?\"**\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nThis question is meaningful for several reasons:\n\n* **Addresses a current debate:** Homeopathic drugs are a controversial topic in healthcare.  Their efficacy is widely debated, and questions about their safety, particularly compared to conventional drugs, are relevant for public health and regulatory bodies.\n* **Utilizes available data:** The database contains information on both homeopathic and non-homeopathic drugs. The `active_ingredients` table shows examples of homeopathic ingredients (e.g., \"HISTAMINE DIHYDROCHLORIDE\" with homeopathic potency notations like \"[hp_C]/1\"). The `products` table categorizes some as \"UNAPPROVED HOMEOPATHIC\".  The `reactions` table captures reported adverse events.\n* **Focuses on safety:** The core of the question is about drug safety, specifically comparing the safety profiles of these two distinct categories of drugs.\n* **Exploratory and hypothesis-generating:**  This question is primarily exploratory.  We are not necessarily expecting to prove homeopathy is inherently unsafe or safe, but rather to see if the data *suggests* any differences in reported adverse reactions that warrant further investigation. This can be hypothesis-generating for future, more targeted research.\n\n**Research Strategy:**\n\nTo investigate this research question using the provided database, we can employ the following strategy:\n\n**Phase 1: Data Extraction and Preparation**\n\n1. **Identify Homeopathic vs. Non-Homeopathic Drugs:**\n    * **From `products` table:** Use the `marketing_category` field.  Identify products with `marketing_category = 'UNAPPROVED HOMEOPATHIC'` as the homeopathic group.\n    * **From `products` table:**  Products with `marketing_category` other than 'UNAPPROVED HOMEOPATHIC' (e.g., 'NDA', 'OTC', 'ANDA') will be considered the non-homeopathic group (conventional drugs).\n    * **Refinement (Optional but recommended):**  Review `active_ingredients` table for products identified as 'UNAPPROVED HOMEOPATHIC' to confirm they contain ingredients typically associated with homeopathy (e.g., highly diluted substances, plant/animal extracts with homeopathic names).  Conversely, confirm non-homeopathic drugs contain ingredients known for pharmacological activity (e.g., ibuprofen).\n\n2. **Extract Adverse Reaction Data:**\n    * **From `reactions` table:** Extract `meddra_pt` (MedDRA Preferred Term for reaction) for all reactions.\n    * **Link reactions to drugs:** Join `reactions` table with `patients` table using `patient_id`, then join `patients` table with `drugs` table using `patient_id` again (or directly join `reactions` to `drugs` if a direct patient-drug link exists, though it's not explicitly shown in the schema, `patient_id` is the likely bridge). Finally, link `drugs` to `products` table via `drug_id` to categorize drugs as homeopathic or non-homeopathic (identified in step 1).\n\n3. **Data Cleaning and Grouping:**\n    * **Standardize reaction terms:**  While `meddra_pt` is standardized, review for any data quality issues or potential need for further grouping of similar reaction terms if granularity is too high for meaningful comparison.\n    * **Group reactions by drug type:** Categorize each reaction record as associated with either a homeopathic drug or a non-homeopathic drug based on the product categorization in step 1.\n\n**Phase 2: Data Analysis**\n\n1. **Descriptive Statistics:**\n    * **Frequency of reactions:** Calculate the total number of reported reactions for both homeopathic and non-homeopathic drug groups.\n    * **Types of reactions:** Identify the unique `meddra_pt` terms reported for each drug group.\n    * **Frequency of reaction types:**  Calculate the frequency of each unique `meddra_pt` term within each drug group. This will provide a profile of the most common adverse reactions for each category.\n\n2. **Comparative Analysis:**\n    * **Compare reaction profiles:**  Visually and statistically (if appropriate statistical methods can be applied given the nature of the data, e.g., chi-squared tests for categorical data if counts are sufficient) compare the types and frequencies of reported reactions between the homeopathic and non-homeopathic drug groups.\n    * **Identify statistically significant differences:** Determine if there are specific reaction types that are significantly more or less frequently reported for one group compared to the other.\n    * **Explore potential differences:**  Analyze if the types of reactions reported differ qualitatively between the two groups (e.g., are homeopathic reactions primarily mild and self-limiting, while non-homeopathic reactions include more serious events? - *This would be a very speculative initial analysis given the data provided, but could inform future research if trends emerge*).\n\n3. **Consider Severity (if possible):**\n    * **Explore `reports` and `patients` tables:** If the `reports` or `patients` tables provide information about reaction severity (e.g., seriousness flag in `reports` table, though it applies to the report itself, not necessarily individual reactions), attempt to incorporate severity into the comparison. Are serious reactions reported more or less frequently for either group? *However, based on the provided schema, direct reaction severity is not readily available.*\n\n**Phase 3: Interpretation and Conclusion**\n\n1. **Summarize Findings:**  Present the descriptive statistics and comparative analysis results clearly.\n2. **Interpret Differences (or lack thereof):**  Discuss any observed differences (or lack of significant differences) in reaction profiles.\n3. **Consider Limitations:** Acknowledge the limitations of this analysis:\n    * **Data Source:** This database likely represents spontaneous adverse event reports, which are subject to reporting bias.  Under-reporting of adverse events, especially for products perceived as \"natural\" or \"safe,\" could be more prevalent for homeopathic drugs.\n    * **Causality:**  The data doesn't establish causality. Reactions are reported in association with drug use, but may not be *caused* by the drug.\n    * **Exposure Data:**  We don't have data on the overall usage or exposure rates of homeopathic vs. non-homeopathic drugs in the patient population.  Differences in reporting may simply reflect differences in usage volume.\n    * **Specificity of Homeopathic Categorization:** The \"UNAPPROVED HOMEOPATHIC\" category might be broad and include diverse products.\n    * **Lack of Device Data:** The tables are heavily focused on drugs, limiting the ability to address medical device safety directly with this specific dataset.\n\n4. **Formulate Further Research Directions:** Based on the findings and limitations, suggest potential next steps for research. This could include:\n    * More detailed analysis of specific reaction types.\n    * Investigating reporting biases.\n    * Integrating external data sources (e.g., sales data for exposure estimation, more detailed clinical information).\n    * Focusing on specific homeopathic ingredients or product categories.\n    * Exploring enforcement data related to homeopathic vs. non-homeopathic products from the `enforcements` and `enforcement_openfda` tables.\n\n**Expected Outcomes:**\n\n* **Descriptive profiles:**  Characterization of the reported adverse reaction profiles for both homeopathic and non-homeopathic drugs in the database.\n* **Comparative insights:** Identification of any statistically noticeable differences in the types and frequencies of reported adverse reactions between the two groups.\n* **Hypothesis generation:** The analysis may generate hypotheses about potential differences in safety profiles that can be tested in more rigorous, targeted studies.\n* **Informed discussion:** The findings can contribute to a more data-driven discussion about the safety of homeopathic drugs in the context of reported adverse events.\n\n**This research strategy provides a framework to explore drug safety within the given database, focusing on a relevant and debated topic using the available data points.** It is important to interpret the results cautiously, considering the inherent limitations of spontaneous adverse event reporting data.",

Store this list (e.g., as `non_homeopathic_product_ids`).\n\n3.  **Extract Adverse Reactions for Homeopathic Drugs:**\n    *   **Action:** Join `reactions`, `patients`, `drugs`, `drug_openfda`, `product_openfda`, and `products` tables to retrieve `meddra_pt` values for reactions potentially associated with homeopathic products identified in step 1.\n    *   **SQL Query:**\n        ```sql\n        SELECT r.meddra_pt\n        FROM reactions r\n        JOIN patients p ON r.patient_id = p.patient_id\n        JOIN drugs d ON p.patient_id = d.patient_id\n        JOIN drug_openfda dofda ON d.drug_id = dofda.drug_id\n        JOIN product_openfda pofda ON dofda.openfda_id = pofda.openfda_id\n        JOIN products prod ON pofda.product_id = prod.product_id\n        WHERE prod.product_id IN (/* List of homeopathic_product_ids from Step 1 */);\n        ```\n    *   **Tables:** `reactions`, `patients`, `drugs`, `drug_openfda`, `product_openfda`, `products`\n    *   **Fields:**\n        *   `reactions`: `meddra_pt`, `patient_id`\n        *   `patients`: `patient_id`\n        *   `drugs`: `patient_id`, `drug_id`\n        *   `drug_openfda`: `drug_id`, `openfda_id`\n        *   `product_openfda`: `openfda_id`, `product_id`\n        *   `products`: `product_id`\n    *   **Output:** A list of `meddra_pt` values representing adverse reactions reported for homeopathic drugs. Store this list (e.g., as `homeopathic_reaction_terms`).\n\n4.  **Extract Adverse Reactions for Non-Homeopathic Drugs:**\n    *   **Action:** Similar to step 3, but filter for non-homeopathic products identified in step 2.\n    *   **SQL Query:**\n        ```sql\n        SELECT r.meddra_pt\n        FROM reactions r\n        JOIN patients p ON r.patient_id = p.patient_id\n        JOIN drugs d ON p.patient_id = d.patient_id\n        JOIN drug_openfda dofda ON d.drug_id = dofda.drug_id\n        JOIN product_openfda pofda ON dofda.openfda_id = pofda.openfda_id\n        JOIN products prod ON pofda.product_id = prod.product_id\n        WHERE prod.product_id IN (/* List of non_homeopathic_product_ids from Step 2 */);\n        ```\n    *   **Tables:** `reactions`, `patients`, `drugs`, `drug_openfda`, `product_openfda`, `products`\n    *   **Fields:** (Same as step 3)\n        *   `reactions`: `meddra_pt`, `patient_id`\n        *   `patients`: `patient_id`\n        *   `drugs`: `patient_id`, `drug_id`\n        *   `drug_openfda`: `drug_id`, `openfda_id`\n        *   `product_openfda`: `openfda_id`, `product_id`\n        *   `products`: `product_id`\n    *   **Output:** A list of `meddra_pt` values representing adverse reactions reported for non-homeopathic drugs. Store this list (e.g., as `non_homeopathic_reaction_terms`).\n\n**Phase 2: Data Analysis**\n\n5.  **Count Reaction Frequencies for Homeopathic Drugs:**\n    *   **Action:** Count the occurrences of each unique `meddra_pt` for homeopathic drugs.\n    *   **SQL Query:**\n        ```sql\n        SELECT r.meddra_pt, COUNT(*) AS reaction_frequency\n        FROM reactions r\n        JOIN patients p ON r.patient_id = p.patient_id\n        JOIN drugs d ON p.patient_id = d.patient_id\n        JOIN drug_openfda dofda ON d.drug_id = dofda.drug_id\n        JOIN product_openfda pofda ON dofda.openfda_id = pofda.openfda_id\n        JOIN products prod ON pofda.product_id = prod.product_id\n        WHERE prod.product_id IN (/* List of homeopathic_product_ids from Step 1 */)\n        GROUP BY r.meddra_pt\n        ORDER BY reaction_frequency DESC;\n        ```\n    *   **Tables:** `reactions`, `patients`, `drugs`, `drug_openfda`, `product_openfda`, `products`\n    *   **Fields:** `reactions.meddra_pt`, `reactions.patient_id`, `patients.patient_id`, `drugs.patient_id`, `drugs.drug_id`, `drug_openfda.drug_id`, `drug_openfda.openfda_id`, `product_openfda.openfda_id`, `product_openfda.product_id`, `products.product_id`\n    *   **Output:** A table showing each unique `meddra_pt` reported for homeopathic drugs and its frequency.\n\n6.  **Count Reaction Frequencies for Non-Homeopathic Drugs:**\n    *   **Action:** Count the occurrences of each unique `meddra_pt` for non-homeopathic drugs.\n    *   **SQL Query:**\n        ```sql\n        SELECT r.meddra_pt, COUNT(*) AS reaction_frequency\n        FROM reactions r\n        JOIN patients p ON r.patient_id = p.patient_id\n        JOIN drugs d ON p.patient_id = d.patient_id\n        JOIN drug_openfda dofda ON d.drug_id = dofda.drug_id\n        JOIN product_openfda pofda ON dofda.openfda_id = pofda.openfda_id\n        JOIN products prod ON pofda.product_id = prod.product_id\n        WHERE prod.product_id IN (/* List of non_homeopathic_product_ids from Step 2 */)\n        GROUP BY r.meddra_pt\n        ORDER BY reaction_frequency DESC;\n        ```\n    *   **Tables:** `reactions`, `patients`, `drugs`, `drug_openfda`, `product_openfda`, `products`\n    *   **Fields:** (Same as step 5)\n    *   **Output:** A table showing each unique `meddra_pt` reported for non-homeopathic drugs and its frequency.\n\n7.  **Optional Refinement - Verify Homeopathic Ingredients (Example):**\n    *   **Action:** To further verify the categorization of homeopathic products, query the `active_ingredients` table to check for characteristic homeopathic ingredients for products categorized as 'UNAPPROVED HOMEOPATHIC'.\n    *   **SQL Query (Example checking for 'HISTAMINE DIHYDROCHLORIDE'):**\n        ```sql\n        SELECT ai.name, prod.product_id\n        FROM active_ingredients ai\n        JOIN products prod ON ai.product_id = prod.product_id\n        WHERE prod.marketing_category = 'UNAPPROVED HOMEOPATHIC'\n        AND ai.name LIKE '%HISTAMINE DIHYDROCHLORIDE%'; -- Example homeopathic ingredient\n        ```\n    *   **Tables:** `active_ingredients`, `products`\n    *   **Fields:** `active_ingredients.name`, `active_ingredients.product_id`, `products.product_id`, `products.marketing_category`\n    *   **Output:** List of ingredient names and `product_id`s for homeopathic products, allowing for manual review and verification of homeopathic nature. You can repeat this with other known homeopathic ingredient examples.\n\n**Phase 3: Interpretation and Conclusion**\n\n*   **Action:**  Analyze and compare the output from steps 5 and 6. Calculate descriptive statistics (e.g., total reactions, number of unique reaction types, top reaction types for each group).  Perform comparative analysis (visual comparisons of frequency distributions, potentially statistical tests if data allows and assumptions are met).\n*   **Tables:** No further queries needed at this stage; analysis is performed on the results from previous steps.\n*   **Fields:**  `meddra_pt`, `reaction_frequency` (from outputs of steps 5 and 6).\n*   **Output:** Interpretation of the differences (or lack thereof) in adverse reaction profiles between homeopathic and non-homeopathic drugs, considering the limitations of the data.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n*   **Join Logic Correction:** The SQL queries now correctly join `drugs` to `products` via the `drug_openfda` and `product_openfda` tables. This approach is more aligned with the provided database schema.\n*   **Data Source Awareness:** It's important to note that the `reactions` and `drugs` tables likely originate from a different data source (FAERS - adverse event reports) than the `products` and openFDA tables (product labeling and registration). The linkage through `drug_openfda` and `product_openfda` is an attempt to connect these datasets, but it might not be perfect and could introduce limitations in the analysis. The `drug_id` in `drugs` table and `drug_id` in `drug_openfda` likely represent the same drug concept, and similarly `openfda_id` in `drug_openfda` and `product_openfda` is likely a common identifier, and `product_id` in `product_openfda` and `products` table is also likely a common identifier. However, the data integration quality should be carefully considered.\n*   **Assumed Joins:** The SQL queries assume the described relationships between tables based on common column names. Verify these relationships in your specific database environment.\n*   **Data Volume and Optimization:** Be mindful of data volume. Consider indexing relevant columns (e.g., foreign key columns) for query performance optimization, especially for joins on large tables.\n*   **Data Cleaning and Standardization:** Data quality in `meddra_pt` and `marketing_category` should be assessed. Consider data cleaning steps if inconsistencies or variations in terminology are found.\n*   **Statistical Rigor:** If statistical tests are planned, ensure that the data and analysis approach meet the assumptions of the chosen statistical methods.\n*   **Interpretation Caveats:** Always interpret the results considering the inherent limitations of spontaneous reporting systems for adverse events and the potential data integration challenges highlighted above.\n\nBy implementing these optimized steps, you can execute a more robust and accurate analysis of the potential differences in adverse reaction profiles between homeopathic and non-homeopathic drugs, while also being aware of the data limitations.\n```",

The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling: \u2022 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis [see BOXED WARNING and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.1 )] \u2022 Cerebrovascular Adverse Events, Including Stroke [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.2 )] \u2022 Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Children, Adolescents, and Young Adults [see BOXED WARNING and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.3 )] \u2022 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.4 )] \u2022 Tardive Dyskinesia [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.5 )] \u2022 Metabolic Changes [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.6 )] \u2022 Orthostatic Hypotension [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.7 )] \u2022 Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.8 )] \u2022 Seizures/Convulsions [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.9 )] \u2022 Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.10 )] \u2022 Body Temperature Regulation [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.11 )] \u2022 Suicide [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.12 )] \u2022 Dysphagia [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.13 )] The most common adverse reactions in adult patients in clinical trials (\u226510%) were nausea, vomiting, constipation, headache, dizziness, akathisia, anxiety, insomnia, and restlessness. The most common adverse reactions in the pediatric clinical trials (\u226510%) were somnolence, headache, vomiting, extrapyramidal disorder, fatigue, increased appetite, insomnia, nausea, nasopharyngitis, and weight increased. Aripiprazole has been evaluated for safety in 13,543 adult patients who participated in multiple-dose, clinical trials in schizophrenia, other indications, Dementia of the Alzheimer's type, Parkinson's disease, and alcoholism, and who had approximately 7619 patient-years of exposure to oral aripiprazole tablets . A total of 3390 patients were treated with oral aripiprazole tablets for at least 180 days and 1933 patients treated with oral aripiprazole tablets had at least 1 year of exposure. Aripiprazole has been evaluated for safety in 1,686 patients (6 to 18 years) who participated in multiple-dose, clinical trials in schizophrenia, or other indications and who had approximately 1,342 patient-years of exposure to oral aripiprazole. A total of 959 pediatric patients were treated with oral aripiprazole for at least 180 days and 556 pediatric patients treated with oral aripiprazole had at least 1 year of exposure. The conditions and duration of treatment with aripiprazole tablets included (in overlapping categories) double-blind, comparative and noncomparative open-label studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, fixed- and flexible-dose studies, and short- and longer-term exposure. Additional pediatric use information is approved for Otsuka America Pharmaceutical, Inc.'s ABILIFY \u00ae (aripiprazole) product.

Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions The only commonly observed adverse reaction associated with the use of aripiprazole tablets in patients with schizophrenia (incidence of 5% or greater and aripiprazole tablets incidence at least twice that for placebo) was akathisia (aripiprazole tablets 8%; placebo 4%). Less Common Adverse Reactions in Adults Table 10 enumerates the pooled incidence, rounded to the nearest percent, of adverse reactions that occurred during acute therapy (up to 6 weeks in schizophrenia and up to 3 weeks in another indication), including only those reactions that occurred in 2% or more of patients treated with aripiprazole tablets (doses \u22652 mg/day) and for which the incidence in patients treated with aripiprazole tablets was greater than the incidence in patients treated with placebo in the combined dataset.

An examination of population subgroups did not reveal any clear evidence of differential adverse reaction incidence on the basis of age, gender, or race. P ediatric Patients (13 to 17 years) with Schizophrenia The following findings are based on one 6-week, placebo-controlled trial in which oral aripiprazole tablet was administered in doses ranging from 2 to 30 mg/day. Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment The incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions between aripiprazole tablets-treated and placebo-treated pediatric patients (13 to 17 years) was 5% and 2%, respectively. Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions Commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of aripiprazole tablets in adolescent patients with schizophrenia (incidence of 5% or greater and aripiprazole tablets incidence at least twice that for placebo) were extrapyramidal disorder, somnolence, and tremor. Less Common Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients (6 to 18 years) with Schizophrenia, or Other Indications Table 11 enumerates the pooled incidence, rounded to the nearest percent, of adverse reactions that occurred during acute therapy (up to 6 weeks in schizophrenia, up to 4 weeks in one indication, up to 8 weeks in another indication, and up to 10 weeks in another indication), including only those reactions that occurred in 2% or more of pediatric patients treated with aripiprazole tablets (doses \u22652 mg/day) and for which the incidence in patients treated with aripiprazole tablets was greater than the incidence in patients treated with placebo.

Dose-Related Adverse Reactions Schizophrenia Dose response relationships for the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events were evaluated from four trials in adult patients with schizophrenia comparing various fixed doses (2, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 mg/day) of oral aripiprazole tablets to placebo. This analysis, stratified by study, indicated that the only adverse reaction to have a possible dose response relationship, and then most prominent only with 30 mg, was somnolence [including sedation]; (incidences were placebo, 7.1%; 10 mg, 8.5%; 15 mg, 8.7%; 20 mg, 7.5%; 30 mg, 12.6%). In the study of pediatric patients (13 to 17 years of age) with schizophrenia, three common adverse reactions appeared to have a possible dose response relationship: extrapyramidal disorder (incidences were placebo, 5%; 10 mg, 13%; 30 mg, 21.6%); somnolence (incidences were placebo, 6%; 10 mg, 11%; 30 mg, 21.6%); and tremor (incidences were placebo, 2%; 10 mg, 2%; 30 mg, 11.8%). Extrapyramidal Symptoms Schizophrenia In short-term, placebo-controlled trials in schizophrenia in adults, the incidence of reported EPS-related events, excluding events related to akathisia, for aripiprazole tablets-treated patients was 13% vs. 12% for placebo; and the incidence of akathisia-related events for aripiprazole tablets-treated patients was 8% vs. 4% for placebo. In the short-term, placebo-controlled trial of schizophrenia in pediatric patients (13 to 17 years), the incidence of reported EPS-related events, excluding events related to akathisia, for aripiprazole tablets-treated patients was 25% vs. 7% for placebo; and the incidence of akathisia-related events for aripiprazole tablets-treated patients was 9% vs. 6% for placebo. Objectively collected data from those trials was collected on the Simpson Angus Rating Scale (for EPS), the Barnes Akathisia Scale (for akathisia), and the Assessments of Involuntary Movement Scales (for dyskinesias). In the adult schizophrenia trials, the objectively collected data did not show a difference between aripiprazole tablets and placebo, with the exception of the Barnes Akathisia Scale (aripiprazole, 0.08; placebo, -0.05). In the pediatric (13 to 17 years) schizophrenia trial, the objectively collected data did not show a difference between aripiprazole tablets and placebo, with the exception of the Simpson Angus Rating Scale (aripiprazole tablets, 0.24; placebo, -0.29). Similarly, in a long-term (26-week), placebo-controlled trial of schizophrenia in adults, objectively collected data on the Simpson Angus Rating Scale (for EPS), the Barnes Akathisia Scale (for akathisia), and the Assessments of Involuntary Movement Scales (for dyskinesias) did not show a difference between aripiprazole tablets and placebo. Dystonia Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. Additional Findings Observed in Clinical Trials Adverse Reactions in Long-Term, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trials The adverse reactions reported in a 26-week, double-blind trial comparing oral aripiprazole tablets and placebo in patients with schizophrenia were generally consistent with those reported in the short-term, placebo-controlled trials, except for a higher incidence of tremor [8% (12/153) for aripiprazole tablets vs. 2% (3/153) for placebo]. In this study, the majority of the cases of tremor were of mild intensity (8/12 mild and 4/12 moderate), occurred early in therapy (9/12 \u226449 days), and were of limited duration (7/12 \u226410 days). Tremor infrequently led to discontinuation (<1%) of aripiprazole tablets. In addition, in a long-term (52-week), active-controlled study, the incidence of tremor was 5% (40/859) for aripiprazole tablets. Other Adverse Reactions Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of Aripiprazole Tablets The following listing does not include reactions: 1) already listed in previous tables or elsewhere in labeling, 2) for which a drug cause was remote, 3) which were so general as to be uninformative, 4) which were not considered to have significant clinical implications, or 5) which occurred at a rate equal to or less than placebo. Reactions are categorized by body system according to the following definitions: frequent adverse reactions are those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse reactions are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients; rare reactions are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients: Adults - Oral Administration Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: rare - thrombocytopenia Cardiac Disorders: infrequent \u2013bradycardia, palpitations, rare - atrial flutter, cardio-respiratory arrest, atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, angina pectoris, myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, cardiopulmonary failure Eye Disorders: infrequent - photophobia; rare -diplopia Gastrointestinal Disorders: infrequent - gastroesophageal reflux disease General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: frequent - asthenia; infrequent \u2013 peripheral edema, chest pain; rare \u2013 face edema Hepatobiliary Disorders: rare - hepatitis, jaundice Immune System Disorders: rare -hypersensitivity Injury, Poisoning, and Procedural Complications: infrequent \u2013 fall; rare \u2013 heat stroke Investigations: frequent - weight decreased, infrequent - hepatic enzyme increased, blood glucose increased, blood lactate dehydrogenase increased, gamma glutamyl transferase increased; rare \u2013 blood prolactin increased, blood urea increased, blood creatinine increased, blood bilirubin increased, electrocardiogram QT prolonged, glycosylated hemoglobin increased Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: frequent \u2013anorexia; infrequent -rare -hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypoglycemia Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: infrequent -muscular weakness, muscle tightness; rare \u2013 rhabdomyolysis, mobility decreased Nervous System Disorders: infrequent - parkinsonism, memory impairment, cogwheel rigidity, hypokinesia, myoclonus, bradykinesia; rare \u2013akinesia, myoclonus, coordination abnormal, speech disorder, Grand Mal convulsion; <1/10,000 patients -choreoathetosis Psychiatric Disorders: infrequent \u2013 aggression, loss of libido, delirium; rare - libido increased, anorgasmia, tic, homicidal ideation, catatonia, sleep walking Renal and Urinary Disorders: rare - urinary retention, nocturia Reproductive System and Breast Disorders: infrequent - erectile dysfunction; rare \u2013 gynaecomastia, menstruation irregular, amenorrhea, breast pain,priapism Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders: infrequent -nasal congestion, dyspnea Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: infrequent - rash, hyperhidrosis, pruritus, photosensitivity reaction, alopecia; rare -urticaria Vascular Disorders: infrequent \u2013 hypotension, hypertension; Pediatric Patients - Oral Administration Most adverse events observed in the pooled database of 1,686 pediatric patients, aged 6 to 18 years, were also observed in the adult population. Additional adverse reactions observed in the pediatric population are listed below.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: occurrences of allergic reaction (anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, laryngospasm, pruritus/urticaria, or oropharyngeal spasm), pathological gambling, hiccups and blood glucose fluctuation."

The most frequent adverse events reported for clobetasol propionate topical solution have been local and have included burning and/ or stinging sensation, which occurred in 29 of 294 patients; scalp pustules, which occurred in 3 of 294 patients; and tingling and folliculitis, each of which occurred in 2 of 294 patients. Less frequent adverse events were itching and tightness of the scalp, dermatitis, tenderness, headache, hair loss, and eye irritation, each of which occurred in 1 of 294 patients. The following local adverse reactions are reported infrequently when topical corticosteroids are used as recommended. These reactions are listed in an approximately decreasing order of occurrence: burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, hypertrichosis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, maceration of the skin, secondary infection, skin atrophy, striae, and miliaria. Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids has produced reversible HPA axis suppression, manifestations of Cushing syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria in some patients. In rare instances, treatment (or withdrawal of treatment) of psoriasis with corticosteroids is thought to have exacerbated the disease or provoked the pustular form of the disease, so careful patient supervision is recommended.

Treatment Na\u00efve-Adults: TMC114-C211 The safety assessment is based on all safety data from the Phase 3 trial TMC114-C211 comparing darunavir/ritonavir 800 mg/100 mg once daily versus lopinavir/ritonavir 800 mg/200 mg per day in 689 antiretroviral treatment-na\u00efve HIV-1-infected adult subjects. The total mean exposure for subjects in the darunavir/ritonavir 800 mg/100 mg once daily arm and in the lopinavir/ritonavir 800 mg/200 mg per day arm was 162.5 and 153.5 weeks, respectively. The majority of the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reported during treatment with darunavir/ritonavir 800 mg/100 mg once daily were mild in severity. The most common clinical ADRs to darunavir/ritonavir 800 mg/100 mg once daily (greater than or equal to 5%) of at least moderate intensity (greater than or equal to Grade 2) were diarrhea, headache, abdominal pain and rash. 2.3% of subjects in the darunavir/ritonavir arm discontinued treatment due to ADRs. ADRs to darunavir/ritonavir 800 mg/100 mg once daily of at least moderate intensity (greater than or equal to Grade 2) in antiretroviral treatment-na\u00efve HIV-1-infected adult subjects are presented in Table 6 and subsequent text below the table.

Treatment-Experienced Adults: TMC114-C214 The safety assessment is based on all safety data from the Phase 3 trial TMC114-C214 comparing darunavir/ritonavir 600 mg/100 mg twice daily versus lopinavir/ritonavir 400 mg/100 mg twice daily in 595 antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected adult subjects. The total mean exposure for subjects in the darunavir/ritonavir 600 mg/100 mg twice daily arm and in the lopinavir/ritonavir 400 mg/100 mg twice daily arm was 80.7 and 76.4 weeks, respectively. The majority of the ADRs reported during treatment with darunavir/ritonavir 600 mg/100 mg twice daily were mild in severity. The most common clinical ADRs to darunavir/ritonavir 600 mg/100 mg twice daily (greater than or equal to 5%) of at least moderate intensity (greater than or equal to Grade 2) were diarrhea, nausea, rash, abdominal pain and vomiting. 4.7% of subjects in the darunavir/ritonavir arm discontinued treatment due to ADRs. ADRs to darunavir/ritonavir 600 mg/100 mg twice daily of at least moderate intensity (greater than or equal to Grade 2) in antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected adult subjects are presented in Table 8 and subsequent text below the table.

Serious ADRs The following serious ADRs of at least moderate intensity (greater than or equal to Grade 2) occurred in the Phase 2b and Phase 3 trials with darunavir/ritonavir: abdominal pain, acute hepatitis, acute pancreatitis, anorexia, asthenia, diabetes mellitus, diarrhea, fatigue, headache, hepatic enzyme increased, hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, immune reconstitution syndrome, low density lipoprotein increased, nausea, pancreatic enzyme increased, rash, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and vomiting. Patients Co-Infected with Hepatitis B and/or Hepatitis C Virus In subjects co-infected with hepatitis B or C virus receiving darunavir/ritonavir, the incidence of adverse events and clinical chemistry abnormalities was not higher than in subjects receiving darunavir/ritonavir who were not co-infected, except for increased hepatic enzymes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . The pharmacokinetic exposure in co-infected subjects was comparable to that in subjects without co-infection. Clinical Trials Experience: Pediatric Patients Darunavir/ritonavir has been studied in combination with other antiretroviral agents in 3 Phase 2 trials. TMC114-C212, in which 80 antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected pediatric subjects 6 to less than 18 years of age and weighing at least 20 kg were included, TMC114-C228, in which 21 antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected pediatric subjects 3 to less than 6 years of age and weighing at least 10 kg were included, and TMC114-C230 in which 12 antiretroviral treatment-na\u00efve HIV-1 infected pediatric patients aged from 12 to less than 18 years and weighing at least 40 kg were included. The TMC114-C212 and C228 trials evaluated darunavir/ritonavir twice daily dosing and the TMC114-C230 trial evaluated darunavir/ritonavir once daily dosing [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . Frequency, type, and severity of ADRs in pediatric subjects were comparable to those observed in adults. TMC114-C212 Clinical ADRs to darunavir/ritonavir (all grades, greater than or equal to 3%), were vomiting (13%), diarrhea (11%), abdominal pain (10%), headache (9%), rash (5%), nausea (4%), and fatigue (3%). Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities were ALT increased (Grade 3: 3%; Grade 4: 1%), AST increased (Grade 3: 1%), pancreatic amylase increased (Grade 3: 4%, Grade 4: 1%), pancreatic lipase increased (Grade 3: 1%), total cholesterol increased (Grade 3: 1%), and LDL increased (Grade 3: 3%). TMC114-C228 Clinical ADRs to darunavir/ritonavir (all grades, greater than or equal to 5%), were diarrhea (24%), vomiting (19%), rash (19%), abdominal pain (5%), and anorexia (5%). There were no Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities considered as ADRs in this trial. TMC114-C230 Clinical ADRs to darunavir/ritonavir (all grades, greater than or equal to 3%), were vomiting (33%), nausea (25%), diarrhea (16.7%), abdominal pain (8.3%), decreased appetite (8.3%), pruritus (8.3%), and rash (8.3%). There were no Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities considered as ADRs in this trial. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of darunavir. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: Redistribution of body fat. Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: Rhabdomyolysis (associated with co-administration with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and darunavir/ritonavir). Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Toxic epidermal necrolysis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Renal and Urinary Disorders: Crystal nephropathy, crystalluria"

Adults: The information below is derived from a clinical trial database for quetiapine consisting of over 4300 patients. This database includes 698 patients exposed to quetiapine for the treatment of bipolar depression, 405 patients exposed to quetiapine for the treatment of acute bipolar mania (monotherapy and adjunct therapy), 646 patients exposed to quetiapine for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder as adjunct therapy, and approximately 2600 patients and/or normal subjects exposed to 1 or more doses of quetiapine for the treatment of schizophrenia. Of these approximately 4300 subjects, approximately 4000 (2300 in schizophrenia, 405 in acute bipolar mania, 698 in bipolar depression, and 646 for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder) were patients who participated in multiple dose effectiveness trials, and their experience corresponded to approximately 2400 patient-years. The conditions and duration of treatment with quetiapine varied greatly and included (in overlapping categories) open-label and double-blind phases of studies, inpatients and outpatients, fixed-dose and dose-titration studies, and short-term or longer-term exposure. Adverse reactions were assessed by collecting adverse events, results of physical examinations, vital signs, weights, laboratory analyses, ECGs, and results of ophthalmologic examinations. The stated frequencies of adverse reactions represent the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least once, a treatment-emergent adverse reaction of the type listed. Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment in Short-Term, Placebo-Controlled Trials Schizophrenia: Overall, there was little difference in the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions (4% for quetiapine vs. 3% for placebo) in a pool of controlled trials. However, discontinuations due to somnolence (0.8% quetiapine vs. 0% placebo) and hypotension (0.4% quetiapine vs. 0% placebo) were considered to be drug related [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 and 5.19)]. Bipolar Disorder: Mania: Overall, discontinuations due to adverse reactions were 5.7% for quetiapine vs. 5.1% for placebo in monotherapy and 3.6% for quetiapine vs. 5.9% for placebo in adjunct therapy. Depression: Overall, discontinuations due to adverse reactions were 12.3% for quetiapine 300 mg vs. 19.0% for quetiapine 600 mg and 5.2% for placebo. Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions in Short-Term, Placebo-Controlled Trials: In the acute therapy of schizophrenia (up to 6 weeks) and bipolar mania (up to 12 weeks) trials, the most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of quetiapine monotherapy (incidence of 5% or greater) and observed at a rate on quetiapine at least twice that of placebo were somnolence (18%), dizziness (11%), dry mouth (9%), constipation (8%), ALT increased (5%), weight gain (5%), and dyspepsia (5%). Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of 2% or More Among quetiapine Treated Patients in Short-Term, Placebo-Controlled Trials: The prescriber should be aware that the figures in the tables and tabulations cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. The cited figures, however, do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the side effect incidence in the population studied. Table 9 enumerates the incidence, rounded to the nearest percent, of adverse reactions that occurred during acute therapy of schizophrenia (up to 6 weeks) and bipolar mania (up to 12 weeks) in 2% or more of patients treated with quetiapine (doses ranging from 75 to 800 mg/day) where the incidence in patients treated with quetiapine was greater than the incidence in placebo-treated patients.

Dose Dependency of Adverse Reactions in Short-Term, Placebo-Controlled Trials Dose-related Adverse Reactions: Spontaneously elicited adverse reaction data from a study of schizophrenia comparing five fixed doses of quetiapine (75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg, 600 mg, and 750 mg/day) to placebo were explored for dose-relatedness of adverse reactions. Logistic regression analyses revealed a positive dose response (p<0.05) for the following adverse reactions: dyspepsia, abdominal pain, and weight gain. Adverse Reactions in clinical trials with quetiapine and not listed elsewhere in the label: The following adverse reactions have also been reported with quetiapine: nightmares, hypersensitivity and elevations in serum creatine phosphokinase (not associated with NMS), galactorrhea, bradycardia (which may occur at or near initiation of treatment and be associated with hypotension and/ or syncope) decreased platelets, somnambulism (and other related events), elevations in gamma-GT levels, hypothermia, and priapism. Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS): Dystonia Class Effect: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. Four methods were used to measure EPS: (1) Simpson-Angus total score (mean change from baseline) which evaluates Parkinsonism and akathisia, (2) Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) Global Assessment Score, (3) incidence of spontaneous complaints of EPS (akathisia, akinesia, cogwheel rigidity, extrapyramidal syndrome, hypertonia, hypokinesia, neck rigidity, and tremor), and (4) use of anticholinergic medications to treat emergent EPS. Adults: Data from one 6-week clinical trial of schizophrenia comparing five fixed doses of quetiapine (75, 150, 300, 600, 750 mg/day) provided evidence for the lack of treatment-emergent extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and dose-relatedness for EPS associated with quetiapine treatment. Three methods were used to measure EPS: (1) Simpson-Angus total score (mean change from baseline) which evaluates Parkinsonism and akathisia, (2) incidence of spontaneous complaints of EPS (akathisia, akinesia, cogwheel rigidity, extrapyramidal syndrome, hypertonia, hypokinesia, neck rigidity, and tremor), and (3) use of anticholinergic medications to treat emergent EPS. In Table 12, dystonic event included nuchal rigidity, hypertonia, dystonia, muscle rigidity, oculogyration; parkinsonism included cogwheel rigidity, tremor, drooling, hypokinesia; akathisia included akathisia, psychomotor agitation; dyskinetic event included tardive dyskinesia, dyskinesia, choreoathetosis; and other extrapyramidal event included restlessness, extrapyramidal disorder, movement disorder. Table 12: Adverse Reactions Associated with EPS in a Short-Term, Placebo-Controlled Multiple Fixed-Dose Phase III Schizophrenia Trial (6 weeks duration) Preferred Term Quetiapine 75 mg/day (N=53) Quetiapine 150 mg/day (N=48) Quetiapine 300 mg/day (N=52) Quetiapine 600 mg/day (N=51) Quetiapine 750 mg/day (N=54) Placebo (N=51) n % n % n % n % n % n % Dystonic event 2 3.8 2 4.2 0 0.0 2 3.9 3 5.6 4 7.8 Parkinsonism 2 3.8 0 0.0 1 1.9 1 2.0 1 1.9 4 7.8 Akathisia 1 1.9 1 2.1 0 0.0 0 0.0 1 1.9 4 7.8 Dyskinetic event 2 3.8 0 0.0 0 0.0 1 2.0 0 0.0 0 0.0 Other extrapyramidal event 2 3.8 0 0.0 3 5.8 3 5.9 1 1.9 4 7.8 Parkinsonism incidence rates as measured by the Simpson-Angus total score for placebo and the five fixed doses (75, 150, 300, 600, 750 mg/day) were: -0.6; -1.0, -1.2; -1.6; -1.8 and -1.8. The rate of anticholinergic medication use to treat emergent EPS for placebo and the five fixed doses was: 14%; 11%; 10%; 8%; 12% and 11%. In six additional placebo-controlled clinical trials (3 in acute mania and 3 in schizophrenia) using variable doses of quetiapine, there were no differences between the quetiapine and placebo treatment groups in the incidence of EPS, as assessed by Simpson-Angus total scores, spontaneous complaints of EPS and the use of concomitant anticholinergic medications to treat EPS. In two placebo-controlled clinical trials for the treatment of bipolar depression using 300 mg and 600 mg of quetiapine, the incidence of adverse reactions potentially related to EPS was 12% in both dose groups and 6% in the placebo group. In these studies, the incidence of the individual adverse reactions (akathisia, extrapyramidal disorder, tremor, dyskinesia, dystonia, restlessness, muscle contractions involuntary, psychomotor hyperactivity and muscle rigidity) were generally low and did not exceed 4% in any treatment group. The 3 treatment groups were similar in mean change in SAS total score and BARS Global Assessment score at the end of treatment. The use of concomitant anticholinergic medications was infrequent and similar across the three treatment groups. Children and Adolescents The information below is derived from a clinical trial database for quetiapine consisting of over 1000 pediatric patients. This database includes 677 patients exposed to quetiapine for the treatment of schizophrenia and 393 children and adolescents (10 to 17 years old) exposed to quetiapine for the treatment of acute bipolar mania. Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment in Short-Term, Placebo-Controlled Trials Schizophrenia: The incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions for quetiapine-treated and placebo-treated patients was 8.2% and 2.7%, respectively. The adverse event leading to discontinuation in 1% or more of patients on quetiapine and at a greater incidence than placebo was somnolence (2.7% and 0% for placebo). Bipolar I Mania: The incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions for quetiapine-treated and placebo-treated patients was 11.4% and 4.4%, respectively. The adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in 2% or more of patients on quetiapine and at a greater incidence than placebo were somnolence (4.1% vs. 1.1%) and fatigue (2.1% vs. 0). Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions in Short-Term, Placebo-Controlled Trials In therapy for schizophrenia (up to 6 weeks), the most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of quetiapine in adolescents (incidence of 5% or greater and quetiapine incidence at least twice that for placebo) were somnolence (34%), dizziness (12%), dry mouth (7%), tachycardia ( 7%). In bipolar mania therapy (up to 3 weeks) the most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of quetiapine in children and adolescents (incidence of 5% or greater and quetiapine incidence at least twice that for placebo) were somnolence (53%), dizziness (18%), fatigue (11%), increased appetite (9%), nausea (8%), vomiting (8%), tachycardia (7%), dry mouth (7%), and weight increased (6%). Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of \u2265 2% among Quetiapine Treated Patients in Short-Term, Placebo-Controlled Trials Schizophrenia (Adolescents, 13 to 17 years old) The following findings were based on a 6-week placebo-controlled trial in which quetiapine was administered in either doses of 400 or 800 mg/day. Table 13 enumerates the incidence, rounded to the nearest percent, of treatment-emergent adverse reactions that occurred during therapy (up to 6 weeks) of schizophrenia in 2% or more of patients treated with quetiapine (doses of 400 or 800 mg/day) where the incidence in patients treated with quetiapine was at least twice the incidence in placebo-treated patients. Adverse events that were potentially dose-related with higher frequency in the 800 mg group compared to the 400 mg group included dizziness (8% vs. 15%), dry mouth (4% vs. 10%), and tachycardia (6% vs. 11%).

Bipolar I Mania (Children and Adolescents 10 to 17 years old) The following findings were based on a 3-week placebo-controlled trial in which quetiapine was administered in either doses of 400 or 600 mg/day. Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions In bipolar mania therapy (up to 3 weeks) the most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of quetiapine in children and adolescents (incidence of 5% or greater and quetiapine incidence at least twice that for placebo) were somnolence (53%), dizziness (18%), fatigue (11%), increased appetite (9%), nausea (8%), vomiting (8%), tachycardia (7%), dry mouth (7%), and weight increased (6%). Table 14 enumerates the incidence, rounded to the nearest percent, of treatment-emergent adverse reactions that occurred during therapy (up to 3 weeks) of bipolar mania in 2% or more of patients treated with quetiapine (doses of 400 or 600 mg/day) where the incidence in patients treated with quetiapine was greater than the incidence in placebo-treated patients. Adverse events that were potentially dose-related with higher frequency in the 600 mg group compared to the 400 mg group included somnolence (50% vs. 57%), nausea (6% vs. 10%) and tachycardia (6% vs. 9%).

Extrapyramidal Symptoms: In a short-term placebo-controlled monotherapy trial in adolescent patients with schizophrenia (6-week duration), the aggregated incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms was 12.9% (19/147) for quetiapine and 5.3% (4/75) for placebo, though the incidence of the individual adverse events (akathisia, tremor, extrapyramidal disorder, hypokinesia, restlessness, psychomotor hyperactivity, muscle rigidity, dyskinesia) did not exceed 4.1% in any treatment group. In a short-term placebo-controlled monotherapy trial in children and adolescent patients with bipolar mania (3-week duration), the aggregated incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms was 3.6% (7/193) or quetiapine and 1.1% (1/90) for placebo. Table 15 presents a listing of patients with adverse reactions potentially associated with extrapyramidal symptoms in the short-term placebo-controlled monotherapy trial in adolescent patients with schizophrenia (6-week duration). In Tables 15 \u2013 16 dystonic event included nuchal rigidity, hypertonia, and muscle rigidity; parkinsonism included cogwheel rigidity and tremor; akathisia included akathisia only; dyskinetic event included tardive dyskinesia, dyskinesia, and choreoathetosis; and other extrapyramidal event included restlessness and extrapyramidal disorder.

Other Adverse Reactions Observed During the Pre-Marketing Evaluation of quetiapine Following is a list of COSTART terms that reflect treatment-emergent adverse reactions as defined in the introduction to the ADVERSE REACTIONS section reported by patients treated with quetiapine at multiple doses > 75 mg/day during any phase of a trial within the premarketing database of approximately 2200 patients treated for schizophrenia. All reported reactions are included except those already listed in the tables or elsewhere in labeling, those reactions for which a drug cause was remote, and those reaction terms which were so general as to be uninformative. It is important to emphasize that, although the reactions reported occurred during treatment with quetiapine, they were not necessarily caused by it. Reactions are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: frequent adverse reactions are those occurring in at least 1/100 patients (only those not already listed in the tabulated results from placebo-controlled trials appear in this listing); infrequent adverse reactions are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients; rare reactions are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients.

Endocrine System: Infrequent: hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus; Rare: hyperthyroidism. 2 Adjusted for gender. Laboratory, ECG and vital sign changes observed in clinical studies Laboratory Changes: Neutrophil Counts Adults: In placebo-controlled monotherapy clinical trials involving 3368 patients on quetiapine fumarate and 1515 on placebo, the incidence of at least one occurrence of neutrophil count <1.0 x 109/L among patients with a normal baseline neutrophil count and at least one available follow up laboratory measurement was 0.3% (10/2967) in patients treated with quetiapine fumarate, compared to 0.1% (2/1349) in patients treated with placebo [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ]. Transaminase Elevations Adults: Asymptomatic, transient and reversible elevations in serum transaminases (primarily ALT) have been reported. In schizophrenia trials in adults, the proportions of patients with transaminase elevations of > 3 times the upper limits of the normal reference range in a pool of 3- to 6-week placebo-controlled trials were approximately 6% (29/483) for quetiapine compared to 1% (3/194) for placebo. In acute bipolar mania trials in adults, the proportions of patients with transaminase elevations of > 3 times the upper limits of the normal reference range in a pool of 3- to 12-week placebo-controlled trials were approximately 1% for both quetiapine (3/560) and placebo (3/294). These hepatic enzyme elevations usually occurred within the first 3 weeks of drug treatment and promptly returned to pre-study levels with ongoing treatment with quetiapine. In bipolar depression trials, the proportions of patients with transaminase elevations of > 3 times the upper limits of the normal reference range in two 8-week placebo-controlled trials was 1% (5/698) for quetiapine and 2% (6/347) for placebo. Decreased Hemoglobin Adults: In short-term placebo-controlled trials, decreases in haemoglobin to \u2264 13 g/dL males, \u2264 12 g/dL females on at least one occasion occurred in 8.3% (594/7155) of quetiapine-treated patients compared to 6.2% (219/3536) of patients treated with placebo. In a database of controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials, decreases in haemoglobin to \u2264 13 g/dL males, \u2264 12 g/dL females on at least one occasion occurred in 11% (2277/20729) of quetiapine-treated patients. Interference with Urine Drug Screens There have been literature reports suggesting false positive results in urine enzyme immunoassays for methadone and tricyclic antidepressants in patients who have taken quetiapine. Caution should be exercised in the interpretation of positive urine drug screen results for these drugs, and confirmation by alternative analytical technique (e.g., chromatographic methods) should be considered. ECG Changes Adults: Between-group comparisons for pooled placebo-controlled trials revealed no statistically significant quetiapine /placebo differences in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially important changes in ECG parameters, including QT, QTc, and PR intervals. However, the proportions of patients meeting the criteria for tachycardia were compared in four 3- to 6-week placebo-controlled clinical trials for the treatment of schizophrenia revealing a 1% (4/399) incidence for quetiapine compared to 0.6% (1/156) incidence for placebo. In acute (monotherapy) bipolar mania trials the proportions of patients meeting the criteria for tachycardia was 0.5% (1/192) for quetiapine compared to 0% (0/178) incidence for placebo. In acute bipolar mania (adjunct) trials the proportions of patients meeting the same criteria was 0.6% (1/166) for quetiapine compared to 0% (0/171) incidence for placebo. In bipolar depression trials, no patients had heart rate increases to > 120 beats per minute. Quetiapine use was associated with a mean increase in heart rate, assessed by ECG, of 7 beats per minute compared to a mean increase of 1 beat per minute among placebo patients. This slight tendency to tachycardia in adults may be related to quetiapine's potential for inducing orthostatic changes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Children and Adolescents: In the acute (6 week) schizophrenia trial in adolescents, increases in heart rate (> 110 bpm) occurred in 5.2% (3/73) of patients receiving quetiapine 400 mg and 8.5% (5/74) of patients receiving quetiapine 800 mg compared to 0% (0/75) of patients receiving placebo. Mean increases in heart rate were 3.8 bpm and 11.2 bpm for quetiapine 400 mg and 800 mg groups, respectively, compared to a decrease of 3.3 bpm in the placebo group [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. In the acute (3 week) bipolar mania trial in children and adolescents, increases in heart rate (> 110 bpm) occurred in 1.1% (1/89) of patients receiving quetiapine 400 mg and 4.7% (4/85) of patients receiving quetiapine 600 mg compared to 0% (0/98) of patients receiving placebo. Mean increases in heart rate were 12.8 bpm and 13.4 bpm for quetiapine 400 mg and 600 mg groups, respectively, compared to a decrease of 1.7 bpm in the placebo group [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. 6.2 PostMarketing Experience The following adverse reactions were identified during post approval of quetiapine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions reported since market introduction which were temporally related to quetiapine therapy include anaphylactic reaction, cardiomyopathy, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), hyponatremia, myocarditis, nocturnal enuresis, pancreatitis, retrograde amnesia, rhabdomyolysis, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)."

Parkinson's Disease During the premarketing development of ropinirole tablets, patients received ropinirole tablets either without L-dopa (early Parkinson's disease trials) or as concomitant therapy with L-dopa (advanced Parkinson's disease trials). Because these 2 populations may have differential risks for various adverse reactions, this section will in general present adverse reaction data for these 2 populations separately. Early Parkinson's Disease (without L-dopa): In the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease, the most commonly observed adverse reactions in patients treated with ropinirole tablets (incidence at least 5% greater than placebo) were nausea, somnolence, dizziness, syncope, asthenic condition (i.e., asthenia, fatigue, and/or malaise), viral infection, leg edema, vomiting, and dyspepsia. Approximately 24% of patients treated with ropinirole tablets who participated in the double-blind, placebo-controlled early Parkinson's disease (without L-dopa) trials discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions compared with 13% of patients who received placebo. The most common adverse reactions in patients treated with ropinirole tablets (incidence at least 2% greater than placebo) of sufficient severity to cause discontinuation were nausea and dizziness. Table 3 lists treatment-emergent adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of patients with early Parkinson's disease (without L-dopa) treated with ropinirole tablets participating in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials and were numerically more common than the incidence for placebo-treated patients. In these trials, either ropinirole tablets or placebo was used as early therapy (i.e., without L-dopa). Table 3.

Approximately 24% of patients who received ropinirole tablets in the double-blind, placebo-controlled advanced Parkinson's disease (with L-dopa) trials discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions compared with 18% of patients who received placebo. The most common adverse reaction in patients treated with ropinirole tablets (incidence at least 2% greater than placebo) of sufficient severity to cause discontinuation was dizziness. Table 4 lists treatment-emergent adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (with L-dopa) treated with ropinirole tablets who participated in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials and were numerically more common than the incidence for placebo-treated patients. In these trials, either ropinirole tablets or placebo was used as an adjunct to L-dopa. Table 4.

In the rosuvastatin calcium controlled clinical trials database (placebo or active-controlled) of 5394 patients with a mean treatment duration of 15 weeks, 1.4% of patients discontinued due to adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions that led to treatment discontinuation were: 1. myalgia 2. abdominal pain 3. nausea The most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence \u22652%) in the rosuvastatin calcium controlled clinical trial database of 5394 patients were: 1. headache 2. myalgia 3. abdominal pain 4. asthenia 5. nausea Adverse reactions reported in \u22652% of patients in placebo-controlled clinical studies and at a rate greater than placebo are shown in Table 1.

The following laboratory abnormalities have also been reported: dipstick-positive proteinuria and microscopic hematuria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]; elevated creatine phosphokinase, transaminases, glucose, glutamyl transpeptidase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin; and thyroid function abnormalities. In a clinical trial, involving 981 participants treated with rosuvastatin 40 mg (n=700) or placebo (n=281) with a mean treatment duration of 1.7 years, 5.6% of subjects treated with rosuvastatin calcium versus 2.8% of placebo-treated subjects discontinued due to adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions that led to treatment discontinuation were: myalgia, hepatic enzyme increased, headache, and nausea. Adverse reactions reported in \u22652% of patients and at a rate greater than placebo are shown in Table 2. Table 2. Adverse Reactions Adverse reactions by MedDRA preferred term.

A higher percentage of rosuvastatin-treated patients versus placebo-treated patients, 6.6% and 6.2%, respectively, discontinued study medication due to an adverse event, irrespective of treatment causality. Myalgia was the most common adverse reaction that led to treatment discontinuation. There was a significantly higher frequency of diabetes mellitus reported in patients taking rosuvastatin (2.8%) versus patients taking placebo (2.3%). Mean HbA1c was significantly increased by 0.1% in rosuvastatin-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. The number of patients with a HbA1c >6.5% at the end of the trial was significantly higher in rosuvastatin-treated versus placebo-treated patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ].

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy associated with statin use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. There have been rare postmarketing reports of cognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion) associated with statin use. These cognitive issues have been reported for all statins. The reports are generally nonserious, and reversible upon statin discontinuation, with variable times to symptom onset (1 day to years) and symptom resolution (median of 3 weeks)."

Tramadol hydrochloride tablets were administered to 550 patients during the double-blind or open-label extension periods in U.S. studies of chronic nonmalignant pain. Of these patients, 375 were 65 years old or older. Table 1 reports the cumulative incidence rate of adverse reactions by 7, 30 and 90 days for the most frequent reactions (5% or more by 7 days). The most frequently reported events were in the central nervous system and gastrointestinal system. Although the reactions listed in the table are felt to be probably related to tramadol hydrochloride tablets administration, the reported rates also include some events that may have been due to underlying disease or concomitant medication. The overall incidence rates of adverse experiences in these trials were similar for tramadol hydrochloride tablets and the active control groups, TYLENOL with Codeine #3 (acetaminophen 300 mg with codeine phosphate 30 mg), and aspirin 325 mg with codeine phosphate 30 mg, however, the rates of withdrawals due to adverse events appeared to be higher in the tramadol hydrochloride tablets groups.

Other Adverse Experiences, Causal Relationship Unknown A variety of other adverse events were reported infrequently in patients taking tramadol hydrochloride tablets during clinical trials and/or reported in post-marketing experience. A causal relationship between tramadol hydrochloride tablets and these events has not been determined. However, the most significant events are listed below as alerting information to the physician. Cardiovascular : Abnormal ECG, Hypertension, Hypotension, Myocardial ischemia, Palpitations, Pulmonary edema, Pulmonary embolism. Central Nervous System : Migraine. Gastrointestinal : Gastrointestinal bleeding, Hepatitis, Stomatitis, Liver failure. Laboratory Abnormalities : Creatinine increase, Elevated liver enzymes, Hemoglobin decrease, Proteinuria. Sensory : Cataracts, Deafness, Tinnitus. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tramadol hydrochloride tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Serotonin syndrome : Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs. Adrenal insufficiency : Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use.

Body as a whole: body odor, hypothermia, mucous membrane abnormality Cardiovascular: bradycardia, ECG abnormality, palpitations, syncope Digestive: anorexia, increased appetite, esophagitis, gastrointestinal disorder, tongue disorder Hematologic: leukopenia, lymphadenopathy Nervous: anxiety, confusion, depression, abnormal dreams, hyperkinesia, hypesthesia, nervousness, parethesias, speech disorder, twitching Respiratory: increased sputum, stridor, yawning Skin: seborrhea Special senses: deafness, eye pain, glaucoma Urogenital: dysuria, metrorrhagia, urinary impairment In long-term treatment were two patients with underlying cardiovascular disease of whom one experienced a myocardial infarct and another an episode of syncope. The association with drug is uncertain. Sjogrens Syndrome Patients: In controlled studies, 376 patients received pilocarpine, of whom 5% were men and 95% were women. Race distribution was 84% Caucasian, 9% Oriental, 3% Black, and 4% of other origin. Mean age was 55 years. The majority of patients were between 40 and 69 years (70%), 16% were 70 years and older and 14% were younger than 40 years of age. Of these patients, 161/629 (89/376 receiving pilocarpine) were over the age of 65 years. The adverse events reported by those over 65 years and those 65 years and younger were comparable except for notable trends for urinary frequency, diarrhea, and dizziness. The incidences of urinary frequency and diarrhea in the elderly were about double those of the non-elderly. The incidence of dizziness was about three times as high in the elderly as in the non-elderly. These adverse experiences were not considered to be serious. In the 2 placebo-controlled studies, the most common adverse events related to drug use were sweating, urinary frequency, chills, and vasodilatation (flushing). The most commonly reported reason for patient discontinuation of treatment was sweating. Expected pharmacologic effects of pilocarpine include the following adverse experiences associated with pilocarpine hydrochloride tablets, USP: In addition, the following adverse events (3% incidence) were reported at dosages of 20 mg/day in the controlled clinical trials: The following events were reported in Sjogrens patients at incidences of 1% to 2% at dosing of 20 mg/day: accidental injury, allergic reaction, back pain, blurred vision, constipation, increased cough, edema, epistaxis, face edema, fever, flatulence, glossitis, lab test abnormalities, including chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis, myalgia, palpitation, pruritus, somnolence, stomatitis, tachycardia, tinnitus, urinary incontinence, urinary tract infection, and vaginitis.

Gastrointestinal Reactions: Cholestatic jaundice and hepatitis may occur rarely which may progress to liver failure; glyburide tablets should be discontinued if this occurs. Liver function abnormalities, including isolated transaminase elevations, have been reported. Gastrointestinal disturbances, eg , nausea, epigastric fullness, and heartburn are the most common reactions, having occurred in 1.8% of treated patients during clinical trials. They tend to be dose related and may disappear when dosage is reduced. Dermatologic Reactions: Allergic skin reactions, eg , pruritus, erythema, urticaria, and morbilliform or maculopapular eruptions occurred in 1.5% of treated patients during clinical trials. These may be transient and may disappear despite continued use of glyburide tablets, USP; if skin reactions persist, the drug should be discontinued. Porphyria cutanea tarda and photosensitivity reactions have been reported with sulfonylureas. Hematologic Reactions: Leukopenia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia (see PRECAUTIONS), aplastic anemia, and pancytopenia have been reported with sulfonylureas. Metabolic Reactions: Hepatic porphyria and disulfiram-like reactions have been reported with sulfonylureas; however, hepatic porphyria has not been reported with glyburide tablets and disulfiram-like reactions have been reported very rarely. Cases of hyponatremia have been reported with glyburide and all other sulfonylureas, most often in patients who are on other medications or have medical conditions known to cause hyponatremia or increase release of antidiuretic hormone. The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion has been reported with certain other sulfonylureas, and it has been suggested that these sulfonylureas may augment the peripheral (antidiuretic) action of ADH and/or increase release of ADH. Other Reactions: Changes in accommodation and/or blurred vision have been reported with glyburide and other sulfonylureas. These are thought to be related to fluctuation in glucose levels. In addition to dermatologic reactions, allergic reactions such as angioedema, arthralgia, myalgia and vasculitis have been reported."

Safety trials involved pediatric patients with EE; however, as EE is uncommon in the pediatric population, 249 pediatric patients with endoscopically-proven or symptomatic GERD were also evaluated. All adult adverse reactions to pantoprazole sodium are considered relevant to pediatric patients. In patients ages 1 year through 16 years, the most commonly reported (>4%) adverse reactions include: URI, headache, fever, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, and abdominal pain.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Nervous system disorder: amnesia, convulsion, memory impairment. Serotonin syndrome: Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs. Adrenal insufficiency: Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Anaphylaxis: Anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets. Immune System Disorders: Angioedema, and other hypersensitivity reactions: Androgen deficiency: Cases of androgen deficiency have occurred chronic use of opioids for an extended period of time. Hyperalgesia and Allodynia: Cases of hyperalgesia and allodynia have been reported with opioid therapy of any duration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Hypoglycemia: Cases of hypoglycemia have been reported in patients taking opioids. Most reports were in patients with at least one predisposing risk factor (e.g., diabetes)."

          "section_text": "ADVERSE REACTIONS Nephrotoxicity: Adverse renal effects, as demonstrated by the presence of casts, cells or protein in the urine or by rising BUN, NPN, serum creatinine or oliguria, have been reported. They occur more frequently in patients with a history of renal impairment and in patients treated for longer periods or with larger dosages than recommended. Neurotoxicity: Serious adverse effects on both vestibular and auditory branches of the eighth nerve have been reported, primarily in patients with renal impairment (especially if dialysis is required) and in patients on high doses and/or prolonged therapy. Symptoms include dizziness, vertigo, tinnitus, roaring in the ears and also hearing loss, which, as with the other aminoglycosides, may be irreversible. Hearing loss is usually manifested initially by diminution of high-tone acuity. Other factors which may increase the risk of toxicity include excessive dosage, dehydration and previous exposure to other ototoxic drugs. Peripheral neuropathy or encephalopathy, including numbness, skin tingling, muscle twitching, convulsions, and a myasthenia gravis-like syndrome, have been reported. NOTE: The risk of toxic reactions is low in patients with normal renal function who do not receive gentamicin sulfate at higher doses or for longer periods of time than recommended. Other reported adverse reactions possibly related to gentamicin include: Respiratory depression, lethargy, confusion, depression, visual disturbances, decreased appetite, weight loss and hypotension and hypertension; rash, itching, urticaria, generalized burning, laryngeal edema, anaphylactoid reactions, fever, and headache; nausea, vomiting, increased salivation, and stomatitis; purpura, pseudotumor cerebri, acute organic brain syndrome, pulmonary fibrosis, alopecia, joint pain, transient hepatomegaly and splenomegaly. Laboratory abnormalities possibly related to gentamicin include: Increased levels of serum transaminase (SGOT, SGPT), serum LDH and bilirubin; decreased serum calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium; anemia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, transient agranulocytosis, eosinophilia, increased and decreased reticulocyte counts and thrombocytopenia. While clinical laboratory test abnormalities may be isolated findings, they may also be associated with clinically related signs and symptoms. For example, tetany and muscle weakness may be associated with hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia and hypokalemia. While local tolerance of gentamicin sulfate is generally excellent, there has been an occasional report of pain at the injection site. Subcutaneous atrophy or fat necrosis suggesting local irritation has been reported rarely."

To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Accord Healthcare Inc. at 1-866-941-7875 or www.accordhealthcare.us or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Approximately 2,800 patients with type 2 diabetes have been treated with glimepiride in the controlled clinical trials. In these trials, approximately 1,700 patients were treated with glimepiride for at least 1 year.In clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions with glimepiride were hypoglycemia, dizziness, asthenia, headache, and nausea. Table 1 summarizes adverse events, other than hypoglycemia, that were reported in 11 pooled placebo-controlled trials, whether or not considered to be possibly or probably related to study medication. Treatment duration ranged from 13 weeks to 12 months. Terms that are reported represent those that occurred at an incidence of \u22655% among glimepiride-treated patients and more commonly than in patients who received placebo. Table 1: Eleven Pooled Placebo-Controlled Trials ranging from 13 weeks to 12 months: Adverse Events (excluding hypoglycemia) Occurring in \u22655% of glimepiride-treated Patients and at a Greater Incidence than with Placebo* Glimepiride Placebo N=745 N=294 % % Headache 8.2 7.8 Accidental Injury \u2020 5.8 3.4 Flu Syndrome 5.4 4.4 Nausea 5.0 3.4 Dizziness 5.0 2.4 * Glimepiride doses ranged from 1 to 16 mg administered daily \u2020Insufficient information to determine whether any of the accidental injury events were associated with hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial of 14 weeks duration, patients already on sulfonylurea therapy underwent a 3-week washout period then were randomized to glimepiride 1 mg, 4 mg, 8 mg or placebo. Patients randomized to glimepiride 4 mg or 8 mg underwent forced-titration from an initial dose of 1 mg to these final doses, as tolerated [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. The overall incidence of possible hypoglycemia (defined by the presence of at least one symptom that the investigator believed might be related to hypoglycemia; a concurrent glucose measurement was not required) was 4% for glimepiride 1 mg, 17% for glimepiride 4 mg, 16% for glimepiride 8 mg and 0% for placebo. All of these events were self-treated. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial of 22 weeks duration, patients received a starting dose of either 1 mg glimepiride or placebo daily. The dose of glimepiride was titrated to a target fasting plasma glucose of 90 to 150 mg/dL. Final daily doses of glimepiride were 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8 mg [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. The overall incidence of possible hypoglycemia (as defined above for the 14-week trial) for glimepiride vs. placebo was 19.7% vs. 3.2%. All of these events were self-treated. Weight gain: glimepiride, like all sulfonylureas, can cause weight gain [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. Allergic Reactions: In clinical trials, allergic reactions, such as pruritus, erythema, urticaria, and morbilliform or maculopapular eruptions, occurred in less than 1% of glimepiride- treated patients. These may resolve despite continued treatment with glimepiride. There are postmarketing reports of more serious allergic reactions (e.g., dyspnea, hypotension, shock) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Laboratory Tests Elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT): In 11 pooled placebo-controlled trials of glimepiride, 1.9% of glimepiride-treated patients and 0.8% of placebo-treated patients developed serum ALT greater than 2 times the upper limit of the reference range. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of glimepiride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Hemolytic anemia in patients with and without G6PD deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Impairment of liver function (e.g., with cholestasis and jaundice), as well as hepatitis, which may progress to liver failure. Porphyria cutanea tarda, photosensitivity reactions and allergic vasculitis Leukopenia, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and pancytopenia Thrombocytopenia (including severe cases with platelet count less than 10,000/\u03bcL) and thrombocytopenic purpura Hepatic porphyria reactions and disulfiram-like reactions Hyponatremia and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), most often in patients who are on other medications or who have medical conditions known to cause hyponatremia or increase release of antidiuretic hormone Dysgeusia Alopecia"

Postherpetic Neuralgia The most common adverse reactions associated with the use of gabapentin in adults, not seen at an equivalent frequency among placebo-treated patients, were dizziness, somnolence, and peripheral edema. In the 2 controlled trials in postherpetic neuralgia, 16% of the 336 patients who received gabapentin and 9% of the 227 patients who received placebo discontinued treatment because of an adverse reaction. The adverse reactions that most frequently led to withdrawal in gabapentin-treated patients were dizziness, somnolence, and nausea. Table 3 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 1% of gabapentin-treated patients with postherpetic neuralgia participating in placebo-controlled trials and that were numerically more frequent in the gabapentin group than in the placebo group.

There were no clinically important differences between men and women in the types and incidence of adverse reactions. Because there were few patients whose race was reported as other than white, there are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse reactions by race. Epilepsy with Partial Onset Seizures (Adjunctive Therapy) The most common adverse reactions with gabapentin in combination with other antiepileptic drugs in patients >12 years of age, not seen at an equivalent frequency among placebo-treated patients, were somnolence, dizziness, ataxia, fatigue, and nystagmus. The most common adverse reactions with gabapentin in combination with other antiepileptic drugs in pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age, not seen at an equal frequency among placebo-treated patients, were viral infection, fever, nausea and/or vomiting, somnolence, and hostility [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Approximately 7% of the 2074 patients >12 years of age and approximately 7% of the 449 pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age who received gabapentin in premarketing clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse reaction. The adverse reactions most commonly associated with withdrawal in patients >12 years of age were somnolence (1.2%), ataxia (0.8%), fatigue (0.6%), nausea and/or vomiting (0.6%), and dizziness (0.6%). The adverse reactions most commonly associated with withdrawal in pediatric patients were emotional lability (1.6%), hostility (1.3%), and hyperkinesia (1.1%). Table 4 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 1% of gabapentin-treated patients >12 years of age with epilepsy participating in placebo-controlled trials and were numerically more common in the gabapentin group. In these studies, either gabapentin or placebo was added to the patient\u2019s current antiepileptic drug therapy. TABLE 4.

The overall incidence of adverse reactions and the types of adverse reactions seen were similar among men and women treated with gabapentin. The incidence of adverse reactions increased slightly with increasing age in patients treated with either gabapentin or placebo. Because only 3% of patients (28/921) in placebo-controlled studies were identified as nonwhite (black or other), there are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse reactions by race. Table 5 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of gabapentin-treated patients, age 3 to 12 years of age with epilepsy participating in placebo-controlled trials, and which were numerically more common in the gabapentin group.

The overall incidence of adverse reactions and the types of adverse reactions seen were similar among men and women treated with gabapentin. The incidence of adverse reactions increased slightly with increasing age in patients treated with either gabapentin or placebo. Because only 3% of patients (28/921) in placebo-controlled studies were identified as nonwhite (black or other), there are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse reactions by race. Table 5 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of gabapentin-treated patients, age 3 to 12 years of age with epilepsy participating in placebo-controlled trials, and which were numerically more common in the gabapentin group.

Three double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled -clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of tizanidine on spasticity control. Two studies were conducted in patients with multiple sclerosis and one in patients with spinal cord injury. Each study had a 13-week active treatment period which included a 3-week titration phase to the maximum tolerated dose up to 36 mg/day in three divided doses, a 9-week plateau phase where the dose of tizanidine was held constant and a 1-week dose tapering. In all, 264 patients received tizanidine and 261 patients received placebo. Across the three studies patient ages ranged from 15\u201369 years and 51.4 percent were women. The median dose during the plateau phase ranged from 20\u201328 mg/day. The most frequent adverse reactions reported in multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. Table 1 lists signs and symptoms that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received Tizanidine Tablets, USP where the frequency in the Tizanidine Tablets, USP group was greater than the placebo group. For comparison purposes, the corresponding frequency of the event (per 100 patients) among placebo treated patients is also provided.

In addition, hypotension and bradycardia were observed. The occurrence of these reactions is summarized in Table 2. Other events were, in general, reported at a rate of 2% or less.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Certain events, such as somnolence, dry mouth, hypotension, decreased blood pressure, bradycardia, dizziness, weakness or asthenia, muscle spasms, hallucinations, fatigue, liver function test abnormality and hepatotoxicity, have been observed in post marketing and clinical trials and are discussed in previous sections of this document. The following adverse reactions have been identified as occurring in the post marketing experience of Tizanidine Tablets, USP. Based on the information provided regarding these reactions, a causal relationship with Tizanidine Tablets, USP cannot be entirely excluded.

Tramadol hydrochloride tablets were administered to 550 patients during the double-blind or open-label extension periods in U.S. studies of chronic nonmalignant pain. Of these patients, 375 were 65 years old or older. Table 1 reports the cumulative incidence rate of adverse reactions by 7, 30 and 90 days for the most frequent reactions (5% or more by 7 days). The most frequently reported events were in the central nervous system and gastrointestinal system. Although the reactions listed in the table are felt to be probably related to tramadol hydrochloride tablets administration, the reported rates also include some events that may have been due to underlying disease or concomitant medication. The overall incidence rates of adverse experiences in these trials were similar for tramadol hydrochloride tablets and the active control groups, TYLENOL \u00ae with Codeine #3 (acetaminophen 300 mg with codeine phosphate 30 mg), and aspirin 325 mg with codeine phosphate 30 mg, however, the rates of withdrawals due to adverse events appeared to be higher in the tramadol hydrochloride tablets groups.

Other Adverse Experiences, Causal Relationship Unknown A variety of other adverse events were reported infrequently in patients taking tramadol hydrochloride tablets during clinical trials and/or reported in postmarketing experience. A causal relationship between tramadol hydrochloride tablets and these events has not been determined. However, the most significant events are listed below as alerting information to the physician. Cardiovascular : Abnormal ECG, Hypertension, Hypotension, Myocardial ischemia, Palpitations, Pulmonary edema, Pulmonary embolism. Central Nervous System : Migraine. Gastrointestinal : Gastrointestinal bleeding, Hepatitis, Stomatitis, Liver failure. Laboratory Abnormalities : Creatinine increase, Elevated liver enzymes, Hemoglobin decrease, Proteinuria. Sensory : Cataracts, Deafness, Tinnitus. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tramadol hydrochloride tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Serotonin syndrome : Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs. Adrenal insufficiency : Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Androgen deficiency : Cases of androgen deficiency have occurred with use of opioids for an extended period of time [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Hyperalgesia and Allodynia : Cases of hyperalgesia and allodynia have been reported with opioid therapy of any duration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . QT prolongation/torsade de pointes : Cases of QT prolongation and/or torsade de pointes have been reported with tramadol use. Many of these cases were reported in patients taking another drug labeled for QT prolongation, in patients with a risk factor for QT prolongation (e.g., hypokalemia), or in the overdose setting. Eye disorders \u2013 mydriasis Metabolism and nutrition disorders \u2013 Hyponatremia: Cases of severe hyponatremia and/or SIADH have been reported in patients taking tramadol, most often in females over the age of 65, and within the first week of therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.20 )] . Hypoglycemia: Cases of hypoglycemia have been reported in patients taking tramadol. Most reports were in patients with predisposing risk factors, including diabetes or renal insufficiency, or in elderly patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.21 )] .

  "analysis": "Certainly! Here is the detailed analysis report based on the research question and provided query results.\n\n## Research Question\n\n**\"Is there a difference in the reported adverse reaction profiles (types and frequencies) between homeopathic drugs and non-homeopathic drugs, as evidenced by data within this database?\"**\n\n## Interpretation and Insights on Returned Data\n\nBased on the provided query results, we can derive some preliminary interpretations and insights, keeping in mind that these are based on limited, example data and should be viewed as exploratory.\n\n**1. Identification of Homeopathic and Non-Homeopathic Drugs:**\n\n*   **Homeopathic Drugs:** `Analysis Query 1` and `Analysis Query 8` confirm the presence of products with ingredients and strength notations (e.g., \"[hp_C]/1\", \"[kp_C]/1\") characteristic of homeopathic drugs. Examples include \"HISTAMINE DIHYDROCHLORIDE\", \"LACHESIS MUTA VENOM\", \"ARNICA MONTANA\", and \"SULFUR\". These are listed with homeopathic potencies.\n*   **Non-Homeopathic Drugs:** `Analysis Query 2` and `Analysis Query 3` list products with marketing categories like \"NDA\", \"ANDA\", and \"OTC MONOGRAPH DRUG\". These include well-known conventional drugs like \"Advil\" (ibuprofen), \"Fluoxetine\", and \"Celecoxib\", along with common OTC products like hand sanitizers and topical ointments.\n\n**Insight:** The data confirms that the database contains entries identifiable as both homeopathic and non-homeopathic drugs based on marketing category and ingredient information, supporting the feasibility of our research strategy's first phase.\n\n**2. Adverse Reaction Profiles:**\n\n*   **Homeopathic Drugs - Reported Reactions (Analysis Query 5):** `Analysis Query 5` provides a list of `meddra_pt` (MedDRA Preferred Terms) associated with homeopathic drugs. These terms are:\n\n    *   Foetal heart rate abnormal\n    *   Foetal exposure during pregnancy\n    *   Low birth weight baby\n    *   Off label use (x4)\n    *   Accidental exposure to product by child\n    *   Product use issue\n    *   C-reactive protein increased (x12)\n    *   Dyspnoea (x10)\n\n*   **Non-Homeopathic Drugs - Top Reaction Frequencies (Analysis Query 6):** `Analysis Query 6` lists the top `meddra_pt` terms by frequency for non-homeopathic drugs.  Let's present the top 10 with their frequencies in a table:\n\n    **Table 1: Top 10 Reported Adverse Reactions for Non-Homeopathic Drugs (by Frequency)**\n\n    | Rank | MedDRA Preferred Term             | Reaction Frequency |\n    |------|------------------------------------|--------------------|\n    | 1    | Pain                               | 310                |\n    | 2    | Vomiting                           | 297                |\n    | 3    | Hypoaesthesia                       | 283                |\n    | 4    | Paraesthesia                       | 281                |\n    | 5    | Abdominal pain upper               | 277                |\n    | 6    | Product use in unapproved indication | 270                |\n    | 7    | Taste disorder                     | 269                |\n    | 8    | Memory impairment                  | 267                |\n    | 9    | Drug intolerance                    | 263                |\n    | 10   | Asthenia                           | 263                |\n\n*   **Overall Top Reaction Frequencies (Analysis Query 7):** `Analysis Query 7` shows the top `meddra_pt` terms by frequency across the entire dataset, without differentiating between homeopathic and non-homeopathic drugs. Let's present the top 10 in a table for comparison:\n\n    **Table 2: Top 10 Overall Reported Adverse Reactions (by Frequency, All Drugs)**\n\n    | Rank | MedDRA Preferred Term             | Reaction Frequency |\n    |------|------------------------------------|--------------------|\n    | 1    | Off label use                      | 83508949           |\n    | 2    | Fatigue                            | 59956863           |\n    | 3    | Drug ineffective                   | 54743407           |\n    | 4    | Pain                               | 53164792           |\n    | 5    | Nausea                             | 49042118           |\n    | 6    | Headache                           | 48957722           |\n    | 7    | Dyspnoea                           | 48202308           |\n    | 8    | Diarrhoea                          | 44627961           |\n    | 9    | Pyrexia                            | 43581840           |\n    | 10   | Arthralgia                         | 40988376           |\n\n**Insights from Reaction Profiles:**\n\n*   **Qualitative Differences in Reaction Types:**  The types of reactions reported for homeopathic drugs (`Analysis Query 5`) appear qualitatively different from the most frequent reactions reported for non-homeopathic drugs (`Table 1`). Homeopathic reactions seem to include terms related to pregnancy outcomes (\"Foetal heart rate abnormal\", \"Low birth weight baby\"), exposure issues (\"Accidental exposure to product by child\"), and general markers of inflammation (\"C-reactive protein increased\"). In contrast, non-homeopathic drug reactions are more aligned with typical drug side effects like \"Pain\", \"Vomiting\", \"Paraesthesia\", and \"Gastrooesophageal reflux disease\".\n*   **\"Off Label Use\" Prominence:** \"Off label use\" is a frequently reported reaction for both homeopathic drugs (in the list from `Analysis Query 5`) and overall (top reaction in `Table 2`). This suggests a significant aspect of reported issues in this database, potentially warranting further investigation irrespective of drug type.\n*   **Frequency Comparison:** It's challenging to directly compare frequencies from the provided data. `Analysis Query 5` provides a list of reaction types without counts for homeopathic drugs, while `Analysis Query 6` gives counts for non-homeopathic drugs. `Analysis Query 7` shows overall frequencies, dominated by \"Off label use,\" \"Fatigue,\" and \"Drug ineffective.\"  A direct frequency comparison between homeopathic and non-homeopathic reaction *types* is not readily available from this data extract.\n*   **\"C-reactive protein increased\" for Homeopathic Drugs:** The repeated occurrence of \"C-reactive protein increased\" in the homeopathic reaction list is notable.  While potentially non-specific, it could suggest reports related to inflammatory responses associated with homeopathic products in this dataset, although this interpretation needs careful consideration of context and potential reporting biases.\n\n**3. Adverse Reaction Sections from Drug Labels (Analysis Query 4):**\n\n*   `Analysis Query 4` provides example text sections from drug labels detailing adverse reactions for various non-homeopathic drugs (e.g., Aripiprazole, Clobetasol, Darunavir, Quetiapine, Cyclobenzaprine, Lithium, Ropinirole, Rosuvastatin, Tramadol, Acyclovir, Meclizine, Glyburide, Pantoprazole, Cevimeline, Carglumic acid, Mesalamine, Oxymorphone, Gentamicin, Amphetamine, Etoposide, Verapamil, Glimepiride, Gabapentin, Tizanidine, Norethindrone).\n*   These sections are highly detailed, listing a wide range of adverse reactions categorized by system organ class, frequency, and severity.\n*   They highlight the complex safety profiles of conventional drugs, including serious adverse reactions, dose-related effects, and post-marketing experiences.\n\n**Insight:** The drug label excerpts confirm that non-homeopathic drugs have well-documented and diverse adverse reaction profiles, as expected for pharmacologically active substances.  The contrast with the qualitatively different and less clinically specific reaction terms associated with homeopathic drugs in `Analysis Query 5` is further highlighted.\n\n## Validity and Feasibility Analysis of the Research Question\n\n**Validity:**\n\n*   **Addresses a Relevant Question:** The research question is valid because it addresses a current debate about the safety profiles of homeopathic versus non-homeopathic drugs.  Given the widespread use of both types of products and the ongoing discussion about homeopathy's efficacy and safety, the question is pertinent to public health and regulatory considerations.\n*   **Utilizes Available Data Categories:** The database, as evidenced by the query results, does contain data points relevant to the research question:\n    *   Categorization of products as \"UNAPPROVED HOMEOPATHIC\" and other marketing categories.\n    *   Reports of adverse reactions (`reactions` table and `meddra_pt`).\n    *   Information on drug ingredients (`active_ingredients`).\n*   **Exploratory Nature:** The research question is appropriately framed as exploratory and hypothesis-generating. It does not aim to definitively prove or disprove the safety of homeopathy but seeks to explore potential signals within the available data.\n\n**However, the validity is limited by:**\n\n*   **Spontaneous Reporting Bias:** The data is likely from a spontaneous adverse event reporting system (like FAERS). Such systems are known to be subject to significant reporting bias.  Adverse events for homeopathic drugs might be underreported due to perceptions of them being \"safe\" or \"natural,\" or because users may not attribute health issues to these products. Conversely, there might be heightened reporting for conventional drugs due to greater awareness of potential side effects and stronger marketing influences.\n*   **Causality:**  The data cannot establish causality. Reported reactions are associations, not necessarily causations.\n*   **Exposure Data:**  The analysis lacks data on the usage volume or exposure rates for homeopathic versus non-homeopathic drugs. Differences in reported reactions might simply reflect differences in how widely these categories of drugs are used.\n*   **Specificity of \"UNAPPROVED HOMEOPATHIC\" Category:** The \"UNAPPROVED HOMEOPATHIC\" category might be broad and encompass a heterogeneous group of products.  The analysis assumes homogeneity within this category, which might not be valid.\n*   **Data Linkage Quality:**  The linkage between different tables (especially across datasets like FAERS and openFDA) might introduce inaccuracies or incompleteness, affecting the validity of the analysis.\n\n**Feasibility:**\n\n*   **Data Availability:** The query results demonstrate that the necessary data elements (product categories, reaction terms, product information) are present within the database structure.\n*   **Defined Research Strategy:** The proposed research strategy provides a clear, step-by-step approach to extract, prepare, analyze, and interpret the data. The provided SQL queries are a good starting point for data extraction.\n*   **Exploratory Analysis:**  The research question is feasible as an initial exploratory analysis. Descriptive statistics and comparative analyses of reaction profiles can be performed using the available data.\n\n**However, feasibility is constrained by:**\n\n*   **Data Volume and Quality:**  Real-world feasibility depends on the actual volume and quality of data in the database. If the number of homeopathic drug-related reports is very low, meaningful statistical comparisons might be impossible. Data quality issues (inconsistencies in categorization, missing data, etc.) can also impact feasibility.\n*   **Resource Intensity of Refinements:** Optional refinements like manual review of ingredient lists (`active_ingredients` table) to confirm homeopathic categorization or severity assessment (if severity data were available) would increase the resource demands and potentially reduce feasibility within limited project timelines.\n*   **Statistical Rigor:**  Applying robust statistical methods to compare reaction profiles might be challenging with spontaneous reporting data.  The data's nature might limit the types of statistical tests that are valid and meaningful.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe research question is **valid** in its aim to explore a relevant and debated topic using available data categories. It is **feasible** as an initial exploratory analysis within the constraints of the given database structure and research strategy. However, the **interpretation of findings must be highly cautious** due to the significant limitations inherent in spontaneous adverse event reporting data, including reporting biases, lack of causality, and absence of exposure data.\n\n**Recommendations for Future Research Directions (based on limitations):**\n\n*   **Investigate Reporting Biases:**  Future research should explicitly address potential reporting biases. This could involve comparing reporting rates to sales data or conducting qualitative studies to understand reporting behaviors related to homeopathic vs. non-homeopathic products.\n*   **Incorporate Exposure Data:**  Efforts to link adverse event data with drug utilization or sales data would be crucial to move beyond simple frequency comparisons and toward risk assessments adjusted for exposure.\n*   **Refine Homeopathic Categorization:**  More nuanced categorization of homeopathic products (e.g., by ingredient type, potency level, therapeutic area) could provide more specific insights than a broad \"UNAPPROVED HOMEOPATHIC\" category.\n*   **Explore Severity (if possible with richer data):**  If additional data sources or fields within the database could provide information on reaction severity, incorporating severity into the comparison would significantly enhance the analysis.\n*   **Qualitative Data Exploration:**  Qualitative analysis of free-text narratives in adverse event reports (if available in the database) could offer richer insights into the nature of reported experiences with both types of drugs.\n*   **Focus on Specific Reaction Types:**  If initial analysis reveals potential differences in specific reaction categories, future research could focus on those areas for more in-depth investigation.\n\nIn conclusion, while the provided data and research strategy offer a starting point for exploring the research question, the inherent limitations of the data source necessitate cautious interpretation and highlight the need for further, more refined research approaches to draw robust conclusions about the comparative safety profiles of homeopathic and non-homeopathic drugs.",
