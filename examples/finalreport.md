# Analysis Report

Okay, let's break down this medical device adverse event data, following the structure you've laid out.

### 1. Research Question

**Main Question:** What are the most common device problems and patient problems associated with specific medical device types, and how do these problems evolve over time?

**More Specific Variations:**

*   **Focus on Device Type:** How do device problems (e.g., malfunction, failure) and associated patient problems differ among specific categories of medical devices (e.g., pumps, implants, surgical tools)?
*   **Temporal Analysis:** Has the frequency or nature of specific device and patient problems changed over the reporting period (1999-2024), potentially indicating improvements or persistent issues?
*   **Manufacturer Impact:** Are certain manufacturers consistently associated with higher rates of specific device problems, after controlling for volume of devices sold?

### 2. Data Interpretation and Insights

The provided data represents a snapshot of a larger dataset. It includes the results of a SQL query joining several tables, frequency distributions, counts and initial aggregations. We can interpret the following:

**A. Integrated Data:**

*   The SQL execution outcome provides the structure of the combined data. A left join was performed from the mdrfoi table onto other tables such as DEVICE, patient, foitext, deviceproblemcodes, patientproblemcode, patientproblemdata.
*   **Key fields** returned in the combined table include: `mdr_report_key` (unique identifier), `generic_name`, `brand_name`, `manufacturer_d_name`, `patient_age`, `patient_sex`, `patient_weight`, `patient_ethnicity`, `patient_race`, `foi_text`, `device_problem_text`, `patient_problem_code`, `patient_problem_text`.
*   **Date fields** `date_received`, `date_of_event`, `date_report`, `date_manufacturer_received`, `device_date_of_manufacture` are present, these will require data type conversions from the text format.
*  Note that for a single `mdr_report_key` value, there can be multiple records due to joins with `patient` and other tables.

**B. Frequency Distributions of Problems**

*   **Device Problems:**  The query returned a total count for all device problems (586508), without specific textual description, indicating we need to do a join using `device_report_product_code` in `DEVICE` table to the `Ã¯_1` column in `deviceproblemcodes` table to get more specific textual descriptions.
*   **Patient Problems:**
    *   We have counts for various patient problems. The top patient problems based on the counts from the provided data are displayed in Table 1.

    **Table 1: Top Patient Problems by Frequency**
    | Patient Problem Text         | Frequency |
    |------------------------------|-----------|
    | Abscess                      | 32472     |
    | Abdominal Pain              | 36813     |
    | Abdominal Distention     | 6058     |
     | Abdominal Cramps             | 3375     |

**C. Device Type Analysis**

* The initial data gives a count of `problem_count` which is a count of records associated to each device, NOT the number of problems.
* The query returned some information on `generic_name`, `brand_name`, and `manufacturer_d_name`.
    *    Some devices are present such as: "ENDOSSEOUS DENTAL IMPLANT", "AUTOMATED INSULIN DOSING, THRESHOLD SUSPEND", "WEARABLE CARDIOVERTER DEFIBRILLATOR".
    *    Manufacturers are present, such as: "NOBEL BIOCARE AB", "MEDTRONIC PUERTO RICO OPERATIONS CO.", "ZOLL MANUFACTURING CORPORATION".
   * Table 2 shows a sample of generic names and problem counts. Note these are not the problem counts, but the number of records associated with those device names.
    **Table 2: Sample Device Generic Names and Record Counts**
    | Generic Name                                                                      | Count |
    |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
    |PATELLA HANDLE/CLAMPS                                                             | 8     |
    |ENDOTRACHEAL TUBE, HIGH VOLUME LOW PRESSURE (PFHV), CUFFED, PARKER, 8.0MM, BOX/1    | 1     |
    |HIP CEMENTLESS STEM                                                                  | 9     |
    |NON-DEGRADABLE FIXATION FASTENER                                                    | 48    |

   |HIP ENDOPROSTHETICS                                                                 | 11    |
   |JAWS INSERT "HICURA", 5 X 330, LONG PRECISION, MONOPOLAR                              | 1    |

**D. Temporal Analysis**

*   The sample data contains `year_received`, `year_of_event`, and `year_report` fields.
*   Some reports have missing event dates.
*   The table showing the `year_received` and `problem_count` indicates that the `problem_count` is not related to a problem, but the number of records within each year.
*   No detailed temporal trend analysis is performed yet from this data. This would require aggregating problem counts by time intervals (e.g., yearly, quarterly)

**E. Manufacturer Analysis**

*   The initial result gives number of records associated with the `manufacturer_d_name` rather than problem counts.
    * A few manufacturers with associated `report_count` are shown in table 3.
*    It should be noted that the manufacturer name format isn't consistent, e.g. "3M COMPANY" and "3M COMPANY EDEN PRAIRIE" appear as different names.

    **Table 3: Sample Manufacturer Names and Record Counts**
    | Manufacturer Name             | Report Count |
    |------------------------------|-------------|
     | .                         | 1           |
    | 1001 MURRY RIDGE LANE             | 1           |
    | 1 EDWARDS WAY            | 1           |
    | 3B MEDICAL INC              | 1           |
    | 3D SYSTEMS HEALTHCARE     | 3           |
    | 3EO HEALTH    | 1           |

**F. Patient Characteristic Analysis**
* The results give the number of records for each subgroup, not the number of problems.
 *   Patient demographic data is available.
    *    This includes `patient_age`, `patient_sex`, `patient_weight`, `patient_ethnicity`, and `patient_race`.
    *    This data can be used to explore if certain patient demographics are more susceptible to specific problems.

**G. Text Data Analysis:**

* The `foi_text` column provides descriptive information about the events, which may indicate a type of device or patient problem. Some of these have been converted to lowercase.
* Some of these texts include information on implant failures due to loss of osseointegration, and device issues like the inability to hold a charge, signal loss, and cycler malfunction.
