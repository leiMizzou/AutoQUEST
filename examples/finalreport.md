# Analysis Report

Okay, let's break down this MAUDE data, addressing your request for interpretation, insights, and analysis of validity and feasibility.

**Research Question:**

How do device malfunctions reported in the MAUDE database correlate with patient problem codes and specific device characteristics, and how does this relationship evolve over time?

**Data Interpretation and Insights**

Here's a structured analysis, focusing on the data provided, not making assumptions about the entire MAUDE database:

**1. Data Overview:**

*   **Data Volume:**  We have 10 distinct tables with varying amounts of data returned from the sample queries.
*   **Data Types:** The data includes:
    *   **Date Fields (as Text):** `date_of_event`, `mfr_aware_date`, `date_received`, `expiration_date_of_device`, `date_returned_to_manufacturer`, `date_report`, `date_facility_aware`,  `date_report_to_fda`,`date_report_to_manufacturer`,`date_manufacturer_received`, `device_date_of_manufacture`, `date_added`, `date_changed` These are crucial for time series analysis, but they need to be converted into proper date formats and handled with different date formats in mind.
    *   **Categorical Fields:** `event_type`, `dev_prob_cd`, `product_code`, `brand_name`, `deviceclass`, `manufacturer_name`
    *   **Text Fields:** `foi_text`, `event_description`, `product_description`, `lifeprod_life_products_inc_the_filing_of_this_report_is_not_an_`, manufacturer narratives from ASR tables and  `devicename`. These fields will require text processing.
    *   **Numerical Fields:** `patient_age`, which may require type conversion to perform calculations. Some ID fields may also need to be treated as numbers, if necessary.
*   **Key Fields:** `mdr_report_key` is a central identifier, but it's not present in all tables. Some tables may require creating a key (e.g `access_type_and_number`).  `productcode`  and other product identifiers will be crucial for linking device information. `dev_prob_cd` and `problem_code` will be used to join problem code meaning to specific reported incidents.

**2.  Table-Specific Observations:**

Let's look at some sample insights per table, focusing on returned data.

| Table          | Key Insights                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ASR_2011`     |  `report_id` may be used as an ID field, but it is not consistent. `date_of_event` and `mfr_aware_date` often have missing values, indicating not all events have a corresponding `date_of_event`. Multiple records can have the same `mfr_no` (manufacturer number). Many records have same `product_code` and `brand_name`, indicating a commonality of reported events on specific types of devices. Device Problem codes vary.             |
| `DEVICE2008`   | `mdr_report_key` is a main key. `date_received`,  `expiration_date_of_device` and `date_returned_to_manufacturer` are often missing or `null`, showing that not all events are reported with this specific detail or that those fields are not always applicable. Manufacturer names (`manufacturer_d_name`) are inconsistent, needing standardization. Some records have null for `generic_name`. Devices are identified by `device_report_product_code`. Some devices have `device_age_text`.     |
| `DISCLAIM`      |  Contains text related to the disclaimers by the manufacturers, and can be used as lookup values. Each record is different and should be used as a single look up and joined based on the company that is used for the disclaimers.           |
| `foiclass`     |  `productcode` is a key and is joined with `DEVICE2008` using `device_report_product_code`. Provides classification of devices, device name and `deviceclass`. `deviceclass` has values of 1, 2 and U. Some records have different review panels (`review_panel`). `thirdpartyflag` has 'Y' and 'N' flags for certain products.      |
| `foitext2007`  | `mdr_report_key` and `mdr_text_key` are present here, showing a 1 to many relationship between a report and its narrative. This table is a source of free text information that requires text processing to be used.                |
| `mdr95`        | `access_type_and_number` is an ID, and matches with a similar `mdr_report_key` type field in other tables. `date_received` is the only date. `manufacturer_name` and `product_description` require cleaning. `event_description` has free text that may provide additional information. `fda_panel_code` and `fda_product_code` help with categorization. |
| `mdrfoiAdd`    | `mdr_report_key` is the central key for most joins. Has key dates like `date_received`, `date_of_event`, and  `device_date_of_manufacture`.  It has several fields relating to manufacturer contact information, which are inconsistent, incomplete and may be useful. The data may also contain information that can be used to categorize device types, like `event_type`. `remedial_action` is also present.     |
| `patientChange`|  Has `mdr_report_key` and `date_received`, indicating patient records, however, it lacks significant identifying patient information, just a record of the date received.                                |
| `patientproblemcode`| `mdr_report_key`, `date_added`, `date_changed` and `problem_code` are present. This table has `problem_code` and links patient problems with reported events. Many reports have the same `problem_code`, showing that multiple reports use a common code.                                  |
| `patientproblemdata`|  This table only provides the lookup values for the `problem_code`, providing information on what the various codes refer to.                               |

**3. Insights from Data Exploration**

*   **Time Variation in Reporting**: Date fields such as `date_received`, `date_of_event` and `device_date_of_manufacture` will have to be converted to a usable format and allow for creation of new features such as the age of the device or lag in report time. The variety of date formats shows the need to be consistent with data preprocessing steps.
*   **Device Classification:**  The `foiclass` table provides device classes. This could be key for finding correlations between class and type of issue, as well as which are more problematic.
*  **Manufacturer and Brand Variation:** A lot of the device and manufacturer fields require standardization, since there may be several different text representations for the same value.
*  **Free Text Narrative:** Both `foitext2007` and `mdr95` contain detailed event descriptions and other narratives that will be valuable using text mining techniques.
*   **Patient Problem Codes:** The `patientproblemcode` table has `problem_codes` associated with reports, allowing to see which types of problems are more frequent.
*  **Missing Data:** Many fields are incomplete, which will require careful consideration on handling and strategies for missing value imputation.
*   **Variations in Reporting:** Some records are manufacturer reports, while some are from patient, showing a variation in the source type.

**4. Preliminary Analysis Table**
The following tables shows a preliminary assessment of the joined data, which includes the main tables joined to one another for a better look at the available information
