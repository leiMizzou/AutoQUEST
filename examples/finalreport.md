# Analysis Report

Okay, let's break down this MAUDE database analysis, starting with the research question, then interpreting the provided data, and finally analyzing the validity and feasibility of the research question.

**1. Research Question:**

**Research Question:** "Can we identify specific combinations of device problems and patient problems that are associated with an increased risk of serious adverse events, and are there specific device categories or manufacturers that demonstrate a higher prevalence of these combinations?"

**2. Interpretation and Insights from Returned Data:**

The SQL execution outcome provides a good snapshot of the data and reveals some interesting insights.  It's important to note that the SQL execution provided a summary count for each field in the merged table. The counts are not tied to each other, but will be valuable for the EDA steps.

Here is a breakdown, using tables where appropriate:

**a) Device Problem Analysis**

*   The code mapping process was successful as the descriptive text for `dev_prob_cd` is returned and is not `null`.
*  The most common device problem codes are related to 'No Clinical Signs, Symptoms or Conditions', 'No Consequences Or Impact To Patient', and 'No Known Impact Or Consequence To Patient'. This indicates a large volume of 'events' that might be considered benign or expected. This could skew the analysis if not handled correctly, and may need to be considered when computing odds ratios.
*   `Failure of Implant` is also a high volume category, which will be good to target.
*   `Insufficient Information` is a large category, which indicates problems with reporting.
*  `Pain` and `Hyperglycemia` are relatively high volume categories that could be associated with devices.

| Device Problem Description                                | Count    |
|----------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| No Clinical Signs, Symptoms or Conditions                | 4,629,601 |
| No Consequences Or Impact To Patient                     | 2,270,517 |
| No Known Impact Or Consequence To Patient                 | 1,913,256 |
| Failure of Implant                                         | 1,277,782 |
| Insufficient Information                                  | 994,488 |
| Pain                                                       | 713,491   |
| Hyperglycemia                                              | 649,059   |
| No Patient Involvement                                      | 510,277   |
| Unspecified Infection                                    | 506,233   |
| No Code Available                                          | 316,154   |

**b) Patient Problem Analysis**

*   The data shows `old_to_be_deactivated` (patient problem description) counts.
*  Many of the top patient problem codes are related to not having an impact on the patient, this is similar to the device problem.
*  `Pain`, `Unspecified Infection`, and `Hyperglycemia` are high volume codes.

**c) Report Source Analysis**

*   The majority of reports (`report_source_code = 'M'`) are from manufacturers, which is expected. This may introduce bias, as reports submitted by clinicians or patients may have very different characteristics. This bias should be further investigated in the research.
*   The next most prevalent is Distributor with `report_source_code = 'D'`.

| Report Source Code | Count   |
|-------------------|---------|
| M                  | 544,454 |
| D                  | 36,696  |
| P                  | 3,466   |
| U                  | 1,363   |
| NULL               | 224    |

**d) Event Type Analysis**

*   Most of the event type records are 'Malfunction' (`event_type = 'M'`).
*  The next most frequent event type is Injury (`event_type = 'IN'`).
*   `D` refers to Death, and is a low frequency event. This should still be investigated as the research is primarily interested in serious outcomes.

| Event Type | Count   |
|------------|---------|
| M          | 343,279 |
| IN         | 239,126 |
| D          | 3,253   |
| NULL       | 225    |
| N          | 224    |
| O          | 84     |
| *         | 12     |

**e) Device Class Analysis**

*   The most common device class is `2`, followed by `3`, then `1`. This indicates a larger volume of medium risk medical devices being reported on, but all classes should still be considered.
*   Some device classes are marked as `U`, `N` and `f`. The researchers should investigate what these represent before moving on in the analysis.
* There are 39 reports that do not have a device class assigned which should be investigated and corrected.

| Device Class | Count   |
|--------------|---------|
| 2            | 427,574 |
| 3            | 141,553 |
| 1            | 14,561  |
| U            | 1,364   |
| N            | 962     |
| f            | 455     |
| NULL         | 39     |

**f) Patient Demographic Analysis**

*   The `patient_age` is highly variable, and includes some values that don't make sense, such as '00 YR' and very high days, such as '10220 DA'. The age field will need to be cleaned to remove these erroneous values.
*  The patient sex field shows that there are a number of reports where this field is not filled in (`Unknown`).
*  The majority of the values in patient ethnicity and race are missing. Further research should be conducted to investigate if these fields can be used in the analysis.

| Patient Demographic Field | Level                            | Count   |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------|---------|
| `patient_age`            | (Various)                       | (See Results) |
| `patient_sex_clean`      | Unknown                          | 220,055 |
|                            | Male                             | 191,030 |
|                            | Female                           | 174,314 |
| `patient_ethnicity`        | NULL                             | 522,284 |
|                            | Non Hispanic                     | 62,099  |
|                            | Hispanic                         | 1,016  |
| `patient_race`           | NULL                             | 572,651 |
|                            | White                            | 10,027 |
|                            | Black Or African American        | 1,363   |
|                            | Asian                            | 1,219   |
| (etc)                      | (Various other small categories) | (See Results) |

**g) Time Series Analysis**

*   The data shows that all reports were recorded in 2024. This needs to be investigated to see if the date field was parsed correctly. If the data is all from 2024, then a trend analysis over time will not be possible with this dataset.

**h) Top Device Analysis**

*   The top device names and medical specialties show a wide variety of devices are being reported, and that the data contains a good representation from several medical fields.
*   The top device classes correspond with the most common device names. For example, `Implant, Endosseous, Root-Form` is a device in Class 3, which was a high count in the device class analysis.
*  This demonstrates that the data in the different tables is linked correctly.
*   These fields will be useful for stratification.

| Top Device Analysis                | Level                                                                        | Count   |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `deviceclass`                       | 2                                                                         | 427,574 |
| `medicalspecialty`               | CH                                                                         | 148,277 |
| `devicename`               | Implant, Endosseous, Root-Form                                                    | 141,559 |

**i) Cross Tabulations Analysis**

*   The cross-tabulation of event type and device class provides a clearer picture. It can be seen that for an event type of 'IN' (Injury) it most often occurs in Device Class 2. Device class 3 also has a large number of reports for an event type of 'D' (Death). This is a key finding and should be investigated further.
*  This is important to show the relationship between the event type and the device class. This data could be used to calculate more advanced statistics, such as the odds ratio.

| Event Type | Device Class | Count   |
|------------|--------------|---------|
| *          | 2            | 6       |
| *          | N            | 5       |
| *          | NULL         | 1       |
| D          | 3            | 2,130   |
| D          | 2            | 1,089   |
| D          | 1            | 23     |
| D          | U            | 8       |
| D          | f            | 7       |
| D          | N            | 1       |
| IN         | 2            | 179,059 |

**3. Analysis of Validity and Feasibility:**

**Validity:**

*   **High Validity:** The research question has high validity due to its clinical relevance. Identifying dangerous combinations of device and patient problems directly addresses the FDA's mission to improve medical device safety. This question can directly contribute to risk assessment and identify areas where devices can be improved. The dataset also has high face validity as it is provided by the FDA.
*   **Causality vs Association:** The research design is primarily focused on association. It cannot prove *causation*, only highlight where risks are associated with specific combinations. This is a limitation, but is still valuable for generating hypotheses about causality.
*   **Reporting Bias:**  There may be reporting biases from device manufacturers. Reports could be less likely to be made on 'minor' issues. The researchers should consider if these biases can be mitigated.
*   **Data Quality:**  The data quality could be an issue due to the number of missing values, particularly in patient demographics. This could impact the validity of results. The researchers will need to carefully consider how to handle missing values, or they could introduce bias.

**Feasibility:**

*   **Feasible with Data and Strategy:**  The data provided along with the refined execution steps makes this research question feasible. The SQL queries provided are a good starting point to conduct the research. It does need further work, but is a good first step.
*   **Computational Resources:** The analysis involves large datasets and potentially computationally intensive NLP, but with modern computing resources, this is feasible.  The researchers will need to be aware of data size when running NLP tools.
*   **Data Access:** The success of this project relies on continued access to the data.
*   **Statistical Expertise:**  The statistical association analysis (chi-square, odds ratio) requires the use of external statistical tools (e.g., Python or R), and thus requires an analyst with such experience.
*   **NLP Expertise:** Likewise, extracting themes from narrative data requires familiarity with NLP.
*   **Timeline:** Depending on the team's composition and technical skill, this research could take from several months to a year to complete.
*   **Handling of Nulls:** The data contains multiple null values. The researchers should be very diligent in how these are handled. The strategy of replacing nulls with the term 'Unknown' is a reasonable starting point, but the researchers should consider if there is more advanced methods to impute these values, or if these fields should be dropped.

**4. Next Steps**

Based on the above, the following steps should be considered:

*   **Validate Time Field:** The time field should be investigated to make sure the data is not just for 2024. This can be accomplished by checking the raw data values for the `initial_date_fda_received` field and investigating if this has been parsed correctly.
*  **Refine Data Cleaning:** Refine how missing values are handled. For the demographic fields, consider dropping the fields entirely due to large number of nulls.
*   **Start Statistical Analysis:** After confirming that the date field is correct, conduct the chi-square and odds ratio tests in an external package such as R or Python.
*   **Initial NLP:** Perform a preliminary NLP analysis on a small subset of the data to validate the ability of the tool to find relevant trends.
*  **Data Redaction:** Ensure the data is not being redacted for PII.
* **Investigate Code Definitions**: For the device problem, patient problem, device class and other standard code values, ensure the research team has access to the actual definition of each value so they can be correctly analysed.
*   **Document Decisions:** Document decisions around handling missing data, outliers, and data transformations.

**Summary**

The research question is valid and addresses a critical area of medical device safety. The feasibility of the project is high, but relies on expert knowledge of SQL, statistical analysis, NLP, and good documentation of the whole process. The initial data analysis has provided several key insights into the data. There are still areas that need to be investigated before the project can progress to the next phase.

Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any of these points.
