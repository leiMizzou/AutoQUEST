# Analysis Report

Okay, let's break down this complex task. We'll start with the research question, then move to interpretations of the data based on the provided SQL outputs, and finally evaluate the validity and feasibility of the research question.

**1. Research Question:**

**How do device malfunctions reported in the MAUDE database correlate with patient problem codes and specific device characteristics, and how does this relationship evolve over time?**

As a reminder, here's what the research question aims to achieve:

*   **Correlation:** Understand how device malfunctions relate to patient problems.
*   **Device Characteristics:** Investigate the impact of specific device attributes on failure patterns.
*   **Temporal Element:** See how these relationships change over time.

**2. Interpretation and Insights on Returned Data:**

Based on the execution results from the provided queries, let's summarize some of the key findings, organized into the primary areas of the research question. Please note this data is not comprehensive and only includes samples, therefore the insights are limited to the data provided.

**A. Data Characteristics:**

*   **Date Fields:** Date fields are provided as text strings and will require parsing and conversion to a uniform datetime format in order to do time-series analysis.
*   **Missing Values**: Many fields in the tables contain null or empty values. These will require a strategy for imputation, dropping, or recording the information and creating a new category.
*   **Inconsistent Naming**: In the table `DISCLAIM`, the field `lifeprod_life_products_inc_the_filing_of_this_report_is_not_an_` will require handling, and string manipulation to extract the manufacturer's name.
*   **Inconsistent Key Columns**: Some tables have an `mdr_report_key` that can be used for joins, but this may not be available for all.
