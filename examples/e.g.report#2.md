## Analysis Report: Medical Device Malfunction Trends

**Research Question:**

How have the types and frequencies of reported medical device malfunctions (as indicated by `device_problem_codes` in `ASR_2019` and further detailed in `deviceproblemcodes`) changed over time (from 1999 to 2019), and are there specific manufacturers or device brands (identified in `ASR_2019`) that consistently report a higher incidence of particular malfunction codes?

**Interpretation and Insights on Returned Data:**

We will analyze the data returned by each SQL query to gain insights into the research question.

**Query 1: Annual Report Counts**

*   **Purpose:** To determine the number of adverse event reports in the `ASR_2019` table for the year 2019.
*   **Data:**

| report\_year | annual\_report\_count |
| :----------- | :-------------------- |
| 2019        | 6638                 |

*   **Insights:** This query confirms that there are 6,638 adverse event reports in the `ASR_2019` table for the year 2019. It seems the query was intended to look across the 1999-2019 range, but the result only shows 2019 data. This might indicate the `ASR_2019` table only contains data for that specific year, or the filtering in the query was not effective across multiple years.

**Query 2: Distinct Problem Code Count**

*   **Purpose:** To find the total number of unique device problem codes in the `deviceproblemcodes` table.
*   **Data:**

| distinct\_problem\_code\_count |
| :----------------------------- |
| 871                           |

*   **Insights:** There are 871 distinct device problem codes defined in the `deviceproblemcodes` table. This provides a comprehensive list of potential malfunction categories.

**Query 3: Distinct Problem-Description Combinations**

*   **Purpose:** To count the number of unique combinations of device problem codes and their corresponding descriptions present in the `ASR_2019` data.
*   **Data:**

| distinct\_problem\_description\_combinations |
| :----------------------------------------- |
| 22                                         |

*   **Insights:**  While there are 871 distinct problem codes defined, only 22 unique combinations of problem codes and descriptions appear in the `ASR_2019` data for the specified period. This suggests that only a subset of the available problem codes were reported in 2019, or the joining logic might not be capturing all possible combinations effectively. The query logic uses string concatenation (`ep.device_problem_code || '-' || dpc.old_to_be_deactivated`), which might not be the ideal way to identify combinations, especially if descriptions can vary slightly.

**Query 4: Malfunction Frequencies Over Time**

*   **Purpose:** To calculate the frequency of each device problem code reported in 2019 and compare it to the previous year (although the previous year's data seems to be absent or zero based on the output).
*   **Data:**

| report\_year | device\_problem\_code | frequency | previous\_year\_frequency | year\_over\_year\_change |
| :----------- | :------------------- | :-------- | :------------------------ | :----------------------- |
| 2019        | 1546                 | 2709      | 0                         | 2709                     |

*   **Insights:**  While the query intended to retrieve narrative text, all the `example_report_texts` are *NULL*. This could indicate:
    *   No matching records were found in the `mdr97` table for the specified manufacturers and problem codes within the given timeframe (2017-2019).
    *   The join condition (`asr.manufacturer_name = m.manufacturer_name`) might not be the correct way to link these tables. A more specific identifier like `mdr_report_key` might be needed.
    *   The `event_description` field in the `mdr97` table might be empty for these records.

**Query 9: Consider Device Classification and Other Factors**

*   **Purpose:** To calculate the average number of malfunctions per device class in recent years (2015-2019).
*   **Data:**

| deviceclass | malfunction\_count | average\_malfunctions\_across\_classes |
| :---------- | :----------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| 3           | 7005               | 7005.0                               |

*   **Insights:**  This query indicates that all reported malfunctions in the 2015-2019 timeframe belong to device class '3'. The average malfunctions across classes is the same as the malfunction count, suggesting only one device class is represented in the joined data, or the query is not effectively grouping by different device classes.

**Analysis of Validity and Feasibility of the Research Question:**

**Validity:**

*   **Partial Validity:** The research question aims to understand trends over time and identify manufacturers/brands with high malfunction incidence. The provided data and queries can partially address this.
*   **Limitations:** The primary limitation to fully addressing the temporal aspect is the apparent lack of historical data beyond 2019 in the primary `ASR_2019` table based on the query results. The queries primarily focus on the data from 2019, making it difficult to analyze trends over the entire 1999-2019 period.
*   **Problem Code Handling:** The `device_problem_codes` field containing multiple semicolon-separated values was addressed in the queries using `STRING_SPLIT`. This is a valid approach, but the initial query counting distinct problem-description combinations might not be the most effective.
*   **Narrative Data Linkage:**  The inability to retrieve narrative text in Query 8 hinders the ability to gain deeper qualitative insights into the reported malfunctions.

**Feasibility:**

*   **Feasible with Modifications:**  Answering the research question is feasible, but requires modifications to the data access and potentially the research question's scope.
*   **Data Availability:** The main challenge is the availability of historical `ASR` data for the years 1999-2018. If these tables exist (e.g., `ASR_1999`, `ASR_2000`, etc.), the queries would need to be adjusted to either iterate through these tables or combine them (if possible).
*   **Query Adjustments:** The queries themselves are generally well-structured, but some could be improved:
    *   **Query 1:** Needs to be reviewed to ensure it correctly retrieves data for the entire 1999-2019 range if that data exists.
    *   **Query 3:** The method for counting distinct problem-description combinations could be refined. Joining and then counting distinct combinations of `device_problem_code` and the description might be more accurate.
    *   **Query 8:** The join condition for retrieving narrative text needs to be reviewed and likely adjusted to use a more appropriate key like `mdr_report_key`.
    *   **Query 9:** The grouping by `deviceclass` needs to be verified to ensure accurate aggregation.
*   **Data Quality:** The presence of *NULL* values in Query 8 highlights the importance of data quality checks and handling missing data appropriately.

**Conclusion:**

The research question is relevant and important for understanding medical device safety. While the provided data and execution steps offer a starting point, the inability to access historical `ASR` data limits the ability to fully analyze temporal trends as initially intended. The analysis of 2019 data provides valuable insights into the most frequent malfunction codes and the manufacturers and brands associated with them. To enhance the validity and fully address the research question, access to historical data and refinement of certain query logic, particularly for linking narrative text, are necessary.
