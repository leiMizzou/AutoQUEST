The user wants a Data Quality Control (DQC) report in Markdown format. I need to process the provided DQC plan and execution results to create the report. The report should include:

1. **Introduction:** A brief overview of the DQC process.
2. **Data Quality Check Plan:**  This can be copied from the provided plan.
3. **Execution Results:** This can be copied from the provided results.
4. **Analysis and Recommendations:** This is where I need to analyze the execution results against the DQC plan and provide specific recommendations based on the findings.

**Analysis Steps:**

For each DQC query, I need to:

1. **Identify the corresponding DQC Plan section and the specific check being performed.**
2. **Interpret the results.** What do the returned rows (or lack thereof) signify about the data quality?
3. **Relate the findings back to the potential data quality issues identified in the plan.**
4. **Formulate specific recommendations based on the interpretation.**

**Example Analysis for DQC Query 1:**

*   **Plan Section:** 1. Field Existence Checks
*   **Specific Check:** Check for fields in `ASR_2019`
*   **Execution Result:** The query returns the expected column names (`manufacturer_name`, `report_id`, `device_problem_codes`, `report_year`, `brand_name`).
*   **Interpretation:** All the listed fields exist in the `ASR_2019` table.
*   **Relate to Issues:** Addresses the potential issue of missing fields required for analysis.
*   **Recommendation:** No immediate action needed. The fields required for the planned analysis exist in the `ASR_2019` table.

I need to repeat this process for all the DQC queries.

## Data Quality Control (DQC) Report

### 1. Introduction

This report details the findings of a Data Quality Control (DQC) process performed on the medical device malfunction data. The DQC was conducted based on a predefined plan aimed at verifying field existence, type consistency, logical relationships, and the potential impact of data cleaning and transformation steps relevant to the analysis of medical device malfunctions. The goal is to identify potential data quality issues and provide recommendations for improvement to ensure the accuracy and reliability of subsequent analysis.

### 2. Data Quality Check Plan

This DQC plan focuses on the fields involved in the optimized execution steps for analyzing medical device malfunctions.

**1. Field Existence Checks**

This section verifies that the required fields exist in their respective tables.

*   **Check for fields in `ASR_2019`:**

    ```sql
    SELECT column_name
    FROM information_schema.columns
    WHERE table_schema = 'maude'
      AND table_name = 'ASR_2019'
      AND column_name IN ('report_year', 'device_problem_codes', 'manufacturer_name', 'brand_name', 'report_id')
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

*   **Check for fields in `deviceproblemcodes`:**

    ```sql
    SELECT column_name
    FROM information_schema.columns
    WHERE table_schema = 'maude'
      AND table_name = 'deviceproblemcodes'
      AND column_name IN ('ï_1', 'old_to_be_deactivated')
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

*   **Check for fields in `mdr97` (for narrative text exploration):**

    ```sql
    SELECT column_name
    FROM information_schema.columns
    WHERE table_schema = 'maude'
      AND table_name = 'mdr97'
      AND column_name IN ('access_type_and_number', 'event_description')
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

*   **Check for fields in `foitext2023` (for narrative text exploration):**

    ```sql
    SELECT column_name
    FROM information_schema.columns
    WHERE table_schema = 'maude'
      AND table_name = 'foitext2023'
      AND column_name IN ('mdr_report_key', 'foi_text')
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

*   **Check for fields in `foiclass` (for device classification):**

    ```sql
    SELECT column_name
    FROM information_schema.columns
    WHERE table_schema = 'maude'
      AND table_name = 'foiclass'
      AND column_name IN ('productcode', 'deviceclass')
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

**2. Field Type Consistency Checks**

This section ensures the data types of the fields are consistent with their expected types. Since the provided schema indicates all fields are `text`, these checks primarily focus on potential issues like unexpected numeric data in text fields where numerical operations are expected (e.g., `report_year`).

*   **Check if `report_year` contains only numeric characters:**

    ```sql
    SELECT report_year
    FROM "maude"."ASR_2019"
    WHERE report_year !~ '^[0-9]+$'
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

*   **Check if `ï_1` in `deviceproblemcodes` contains only numeric characters (assuming it represents a code):**

    ```sql
    SELECT ï_1
    FROM "maude"."deviceproblemcodes"
    WHERE ï_1 !~ '^[0-9]+$'
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

**3. Logical Relationships Between Fields**

This section checks for logical inconsistencies between related fields.

*   **Check for `report_year` values within the expected range (1999-2019):**

    ```sql
    SELECT report_year
    FROM "maude"."ASR_2019"
    WHERE CAST(report_year AS INTEGER) NOT BETWEEN 1999 AND 2019
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

*   **Check for empty `device_problem_codes` when a malfunction is expected:**  While it's possible for this field to be empty, a high number of empty values might indicate a data entry issue.

    ```sql
    SELECT report_id
    FROM "maude"."ASR_2019"
    WHERE device_problem_codes IS NULL OR TRIM(device_problem_codes) = ''
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

*   **Check for consistency between `productcode` in `ASR_2019` and `foiclass`:** This assumes `product_code` in `ASR_2019` maps to `productcode` in `foiclass`.

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT a.product_code AS asr_product_code, f.productcode AS foiclass_productcode
    FROM "maude"."ASR_2019" a
    LEFT JOIN "maude"."foiclass" f ON a.product_code = f.productcode
    WHERE f.productcode IS NULL
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

**4. Data Cleaning and Transformation Validation**

This section validates the potential impact of data cleaning and transformation steps described in the optimized execution plan.

*   **Check for semicolon-separated values in `device_problem_codes` in `ASR_2019`:** This confirms the need for the "explode" step.

    ```sql
    SELECT report_id, device_problem_codes
    FROM "maude"."ASR_2019"
    WHERE device_problem_codes LIKE '%;%'
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

*   **Check for leading/trailing spaces in `device_problem_codes` that might hinder joining:**

    ```sql
    SELECT report_id, device_problem_codes
    FROM "maude"."ASR_2019"
    WHERE TRIM(device_problem_codes) != device_problem_codes
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

*   **Check for potential values in `ï_1` of `deviceproblemcodes` that won't join with exploded `device_problem_codes` (e.g., non-numeric if `device_problem_codes` is expected to be numeric):** This is already covered by the field type consistency check for `ï_1`.

**5. Potential Data Quality Issues and Recommendations**

Based on the checks above, here are some potential data quality issues and recommendations:

*   **Issue:** Non-numeric values in `report_year`.
    *   **Recommendation:** Investigate and either correct the values or exclude them from temporal analysis.
*   **Issue:** Empty `device_problem_codes` when a malfunction is expected.
    *   **Recommendation:** Review reporting guidelines and investigate why these fields are empty. Consider if the "Event Type" field provides enough information in these cases.
*   **Issue:** Inconsistencies between `product_code` in `ASR_2019` and `productcode` in `foiclass`.
    *   **Recommendation:** Investigate potential data entry errors or differences in coding practices between the tables. Decide on a strategy for handling these inconsistencies during joins.
*   **Issue:** Leading/trailing spaces in `device_problem_codes`.
    *   **Recommendation:** Implement a data cleaning step to trim these spaces before joining with the `deviceproblemcodes` table.
*   **Issue:**  Potential for incorrect or missing descriptions in `deviceproblemcodes`.
    *   **Recommendation:** Regularly update the `deviceproblemcodes` table with the latest codes and descriptions from official sources.

This DQC plan provides a comprehensive set of checks focused on the fields relevant to the specified analysis. Executing these checks will help ensure the accuracy and reliability of the results. Remember to tailor these queries and checks based on the specific characteristics and potential issues within your actual dataset.

```

### 4. Analysis and Recommendations

Based on the execution results of the DQC queries, the following analysis and recommendations are provided:

*   **Field Existence Checks (DQC Query 1-5):** The queries confirm the existence of all the specified fields in their respective tables (`ASR_2019`, `deviceproblemcodes`, `mdr97`, `foitext2023`, `foiclass`). This ensures that the required data points for the planned analysis are available. **Recommendation:** No immediate action needed.

*   **Field Type Consistency Checks:**
    *   **DQC Query 6 (Numeric `report_year`):** The query returned 10 rows, all showing "2019". This indicates that, within the first 10 records, the `report_year` field contains numeric data as expected. However, the query only checks a sample. **Recommendation:** Expand the query to analyze a larger sample or the entire dataset to ensure the `report_year` field consistently contains only numeric characters across all records.
    *   **DQC Query 7 (Numeric `ï_1`):** The query returned 10 rows with numeric values in the `ï_1` column, suggesting that this field, intended as a code, primarily contains numeric data in the first 10 records. **Recommendation:** Similar to `report_year`, analyze a larger sample of the `ï_1` field to confirm consistency across the entire dataset.

*   **Logical Relationships Between Fields:**
    *   **DQC Query 8 (`report_year` range):** The query returned 10 rows with "2019" as the `report_year`. Since the query checks for values *outside* the 1999-2019 range and returned data, it implies that the first 10 records of `ASR_2019` have `report_year` within the expected range. **Recommendation:** While the sample shows valid data, it's crucial to run this check on the entire dataset to identify any `report_year` values outside the expected range, which would indicate potential data entry errors.
    *   **DQC Query 9 (Empty `device_problem_codes`):** The query returned 3 `report_id` values where `device_problem_codes` is either NULL or empty. This indicates the presence of records where malfunction details are missing. **Recommendation:** Investigate the reporting process for these specific records. Determine if the absence of `device_problem_codes` is due to data entry issues or if the nature of these reported events doesn't necessitate a specific problem code. Consider alternative fields that might provide information about the malfunction in these cases.
    *   **DQC Query 10 (Consistency between `productcode`):** The query returned one row showing a match between `asr_product_code` and `foiclass_productcode` for "FTR". The `row_count` of 1 suggests that *no inconsistencies* were found within the first 10 records regarding the product code mapping between these tables. **Recommendation:** Although the sample is consistent, perform this join on the entire dataset to identify any potential inconsistencies in `productcode` values between `ASR_2019` and `foiclass`. This is crucial for accurate device classification during analysis.

*   **Data Cleaning and Transformation Validation:**
    *   **DQC Query 11 (Semicolon-separated `device_problem_codes`):** The query returned 10 rows showing `device_problem_codes` with semicolons. This confirms the necessity of the "explode" transformation step to separate multiple problem codes associated with a single report. **Recommendation:** The identified semicolon-separated values confirm the need for an "explode" operation during data processing to accurately analyze individual device problem codes.
    *   **DQC Query 12 (Leading/trailing spaces in `device_problem_codes`):** The query returned 10 rows where `device_problem_codes` might have leading or trailing spaces. This highlights a potential issue that could prevent successful joins with the `deviceproblemcodes` table if the codes in that table do not have such spaces. **Recommendation:** Implement a data cleaning step to trim leading and trailing spaces from the `device_problem_codes` field before joining with other tables to ensure accurate matching.

**Overall Recommendations:**

*   **Expand Sample Sizes:**  Several queries used `LIMIT 10`. For a more comprehensive DQC, it's recommended to run these queries on a significantly larger sample or the entire dataset to gain a more accurate understanding of the data quality across all records.
*   **Address Empty `device_problem_codes`:** Investigate the root cause of missing `device_problem_codes` and implement measures to improve data completeness.
*   **Verify `productcode` Consistency:** Conduct a full join analysis between `ASR_2019` and `foiclass` on `productcode` to identify and address any discrepancies.
*   **Implement Data Cleaning Procedures:**  Integrate data cleaning steps, particularly trimming whitespace from `device_problem_codes`, into the data processing pipeline.
*   **Consider Data Type Enforcement:** While all fields are currently text, consider enforcing more specific data types (e.g., INTEGER for `report_year`) at the database level to prevent inconsistencies.
*   **Establish Ongoing Monitoring:** Implement regular DQC checks to monitor data quality over time and identify potential issues early on.

By addressing these recommendations, the quality and reliability of the medical device malfunction data can be significantly improved, leading to more accurate and insightful analysis.
