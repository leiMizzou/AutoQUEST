## Data Quality Control (DQC) Report

**Date:** 2023-10-27 (Generated)

**Prepared By:** AI Data Analyst

**Purpose:** This report outlines the findings of a Data Quality Check (DQC) performed on the `maude` database, specifically focusing on the tables `foiclass`, `ASR_2014`, and `patientproblemdata` and the fields involved in the planned data analysis. The goal is to identify potential data quality issues that could impact the accuracy and reliability of subsequent analysis.

## 2. Data Quality Check Plan

This plan focuses on the data quality of the fields involved in the refined execution steps: `deviceclass`, `review_panel`, `medicalspecialty`, `productcode` from `"maude"."foiclass"`; `dev_prob_cd`, `product_code` from `"maude"."ASR_2014"`; and `ï_1`, `old_to_be_deactivated` from `"maude"."patientproblemdata"`.

**1. Field Existence Checks**

This check ensures that the necessary columns exist in the specified tables. While the structure is provided, it's good practice to verify existence, especially if dealing with database changes.

```sql
-- DQC Query 1
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'maude' AND table_name = 'foiclass' AND column_name IN ('deviceclass', 'review_panel', 'medicalspecialty', 'productcode') LIMIT 10;
```

```sql
-- DQC Query 2
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'maude' AND table_name = 'ASR_2014' AND column_name IN ('dev_prob_cd', 'product_code') LIMIT 10;
```

```sql
-- DQC Query 3
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'maude' AND table_name = 'patientproblemdata' AND column_name IN ('ï_1', 'old_to_be_deactivated') LIMIT 10;
```

**2. Field Type Consistency Checks**

This check verifies that the data types of the relevant columns are consistent with the expected `text` type.

```sql
-- DQC Query 4
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'maude' AND table_name = 'foiclass' AND column_name IN ('deviceclass', 'review_panel', 'medicalspecialty', 'productcode') AND data_type != 'text' LIMIT 10;
```

```sql
-- DQC Query 5
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'maude' AND table_name = 'ASR_2014' AND column_name IN ('dev_prob_cd', 'product_code') AND data_type != 'text' LIMIT 10;
```

```sql
-- DQC Query 6
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'maude' AND table_name = 'patientproblemdata' AND column_name IN ('ï_1', 'old_to_be_deactivated') AND data_type != 'text' LIMIT 10;
```

**3. Logical Relationships Between Fields**

This section focuses on validating the consistency of the fields used for joining the tables.

**3.1. `"maude"."ASR_2014"."product_code"` and `"maude"."foiclass"."productcode"`**

```sql
-- DQC Query 7
SELECT DISTINCT "ASR_2014"."product_code"
FROM "maude"."ASR_2014"
WHERE "ASR_2014"."product_code" IS NOT NULL
  AND "ASR_2014"."product_code" NOT IN (SELECT "foiclass"."productcode" FROM "maude"."foiclass" WHERE "foiclass"."productcode" IS NOT NULL)
LIMIT 10;
```

```sql
-- DQC Query 8
SELECT DISTINCT "foiclass"."productcode"
FROM "maude"."foiclass"
WHERE "foiclass"."productcode" IS NOT NULL
  AND "foiclass"."productcode" NOT IN (SELECT "ASR_2014"."product_code" FROM "maude"."ASR_2014" WHERE "ASR_2014"."product_code" IS NOT NULL)
LIMIT 10;
```

**3.2. `"maude"."ASR_2014"."dev_prob_cd"` and `"maude"."patientproblemdata"."ï_1"`**

```sql
-- DQC Query 9
SELECT DISTINCT "ASR_2014"."dev_prob_cd"
FROM "maude"."ASR_2014"
WHERE "ASR_2014"."dev_prob_cd" IS NOT NULL
  AND "ASR_2014"."dev_prob_cd" NOT IN (SELECT "patientproblemdata"."ï_1" FROM "maude"."patientproblemdata" WHERE "patientproblemdata"."ï_1" IS NOT NULL)
LIMIT 10;
```

```sql
-- DQC Query 10
SELECT DISTINCT "patientproblemdata"."ï_1"
FROM "maude"."patientproblemdata"
WHERE "patientproblemdata"."ï_1" IS NOT NULL
  AND "patientproblemdata"."ï_1" NOT IN (SELECT "ASR_2014"."dev_prob_cd" FROM "maude"."ASR_2014" WHERE "ASR_2014"."dev_prob_cd" IS NOT NULL)
LIMIT 10;
```

**4. Data Cleaning and Transformation Validation**

This section identifies potential issues that might impact the aggregation and analysis.

**4.1. Check for Null Values in Key Fields**

```sql
-- DQC Query 11
SELECT 'foiclass' AS table_name, column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'maude' AND table_name = 'foiclass' AND is_nullable = 'NO' AND column_name IN ('deviceclass', 'review_panel', 'medicalspecialty', 'productcode')
UNION ALL
SELECT 'ASR_2014' AS table_name, column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'maude' AND table_name = 'ASR_2014' AND is_nullable = 'NO' AND column_name IN ('dev_prob_cd', 'product_code')
UNION ALL
SELECT 'patientproblemdata' AS table_name, column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'maude' AND table_name = 'patientproblemdata' AND is_nullable = 'NO' AND column_name IN ('ï_1', 'old_to_be_deactivated')
LIMIT 10;
```

```sql
-- DQC Query 12
-- Specifically check for nulls in join fields for ASR_2014
SELECT 'ASR_2014' AS table_name, 'product_code' AS column_name, COUNT(*) FROM "maude"."ASR_2014" WHERE "product_code" IS NULL
UNION ALL
SELECT 'ASR_2014' AS table_name, 'dev_prob_cd' AS column_name, COUNT(*) FROM "maude"."ASR_2014" WHERE "dev_prob_cd" IS NULL
LIMIT 10;
```

```sql
-- DQC Query 13
-- Specifically check for nulls in join fields for foiclass
SELECT 'foiclass' AS table_name, 'productcode' AS column_name, COUNT(*) FROM "maude"."foiclass" WHERE "productcode" IS NULL LIMIT 10;
```

```sql
-- DQC Query 14
-- Specifically check for nulls in join fields for patientproblemdata
SELECT 'patientproblemdata' AS table_name, 'ï_1' AS column_name, COUNT(*) FROM "maude"."patientproblemdata" WHERE "ï_1" IS NULL LIMIT 10;
```

**4.2. Check for Empty Strings or Whitespace in Text Fields**

```sql
-- DQC Query 15
-- Check for empty strings or whitespace in foiclass text fields
SELECT 'maude.foiclass' AS table_name, column_name, COUNT(*)
FROM "maude"."foiclass"
WHERE (column_name IN ('deviceclass', 'review_panel', 'medicalspecialty', 'productcode'))
  AND (TRIM(COALESCE(deviceclass, '')) = '' OR TRIM(COALESCE(review_panel, '')) = '' OR TRIM(COALESCE(medicalspecialty, '')) = '' OR TRIM(COALESCE(productcode, '')) = '')
GROUP BY table_name, column_name
LIMIT 10;
```

```sql
-- DQC Query 16
-- Check for empty strings or whitespace in ASR_2014 text fields
SELECT 'ASR_2014' AS table_name, column_name, COUNT(*)
FROM "maude"."ASR_2014"
WHERE (column_name IN ('dev_prob_cd', 'product_code'))
  AND (TRIM(COALESCE(dev_prob_cd, '')) = '' OR TRIM(COALESCE(product_code, '')) = '')
GROUP BY table_name, column_name
LIMIT 10;
```

```sql
-- DQC Query 17
-- Check for empty strings or whitespace in patientproblemdata text fields
SELECT 'patientproblemdata' AS table_name, column_name, COUNT(*)
FROM "maude"."patientproblemdata"
WHERE (column_name IN ('ï_1', 'old_to_be_deactivated'))
  AND (TRIM(COALESCE("ï_1", '')) = '' OR TRIM(COALESCE(old_to_be_deactivated, '')) = '')
GROUP BY table_name, column_name
LIMIT 10;
```

## 4. Analysis and Recommendations

Based on the execution results, the following data quality issues and recommendations are identified:

**1. Inconsistent Join Keys (DQC Queries 7, 8, 9, 10):**

*   **Issue:** There are discrepancies in the values used for joining the tables. Some `product_code` values exist in `ASR_2014` but not in `foiclass`, and vice versa. Similarly, some `dev_prob_cd` values exist in `ASR_2014` but not in `patientproblemdata`, and vice versa.
*   **Impact:** These inconsistencies will result in data loss during joins, leading to an incomplete and potentially biased analysis. Records in one table might not find a match in the other, leading to their exclusion.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   Investigate the data loading and update processes for these tables to understand why these discrepancies occur.
    *   Work with data owners to identify the authoritative source for these key fields and implement data synchronization mechanisms.
    *   Consider performing a left join and analyzing the unmatched records to understand the nature and extent of the inconsistencies.

**2. Null Values in `ASR_2014.dev_prob_cd` (DQC Query 12):**

*   **Issue:** A significant number of records in `maude.ASR_2014` have a `NULL` value for `dev_prob_cd`.
*   **Impact:** If `dev_prob_cd` is a crucial field for analysis or for joining with `patientproblemdata`, these NULL values will lead to information loss and potentially inaccurate results.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   Determine the expected completeness of the `dev_prob_cd` field. Is it supposed to be populated for all records?
    *   Investigate the data entry process for `ASR_2014` to understand why these NULL values are present.
    *   If the NULLs represent missing information, explore options for data imputation or consider excluding these records from analyses where `dev_prob_cd` is essential, while documenting this exclusion.

**3. Empty Strings or Whitespace in Text Fields (DQC Query 15, 16):**

*   **Issue:** The `medicalspecialty` and `review_panel` columns in `maude.foiclass`, and the `dev_prob_cd` column in `maude.ASR_2014` contain rows with empty strings or whitespace.
*   **Impact:** These seemingly empty values might be treated differently from actual `NULL` values in certain analyses, leading to inaccurate counts, groupings, or filtering.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   Standardize the representation of missing data. Consider updating these empty strings or whitespace to `NULL` values.
    *   Implement data cleaning scripts to trim whitespace from these text fields during data preparation.

**Overall Recommendations:**

*   **Establish Data Quality Metrics:** Define key data quality metrics (e.g., completeness, accuracy, consistency) and regularly monitor them.
*   **Implement Data Validation Rules:** Implement data validation rules at the data entry or ETL level to prevent the introduction of poor-quality data.
*   **Regular DQC:** Conduct Data Quality Checks regularly, especially after data updates or migrations.
*   **Data Profiling:** Perform thorough data profiling to gain a deeper understanding of the data's characteristics and identify potential anomalies beyond the scope of this targeted DQC.
*   **Collaboration with Data Owners:**  Collaborate closely with the data owners to understand the business context of the data and to implement effective data quality improvement strategies.

This report highlights several potential data quality issues that need to be addressed before proceeding with further analysis. Addressing these issues will improve the reliability and accuracy of the insights derived from the data.
