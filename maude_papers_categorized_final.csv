39397352,A comparison of procedure-related adverse events between two right ventricular leadless pacemakers.,"Oct, 2024","INTRODUCTION: The Medtronic Micra VR and Abbott AVEIR VR are the leadless pacemakers (LPM) currently available in the United States (US). Micra VR employs fixation tines and the AVEIR VR uses an active fixation helix. Micra VR requires fixation before electrical measurements are obtained, while R-waves may be mapped by AVEIR VR without fixation. Little comparative data is available for these LPMs. Accordingly, we compared the incidences of procedure-related major adverse clinical events (MACE) and device problems in the US for Micra VR and AVEIR VR during 2022-2024. METHODS: We searched the FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database for US reports of MACE and device problems that were filed from April 2022 to December 2023 for AVEIR VR, and from June 2022 to April 2024 for Micra VR. Totals for US-registered LPM implants were obtained from the manufacturers' product performance reports. RESULTS: During the study period, 5990 AVEIR VR and 10 940 Micra VR implants were registered in the US. We found 305 MAUDE reports for AVEIR VR (5.1%), versus 541 MAUDE reports for Micra VR (4.9%) (p = .702). The incidence of MACE was 0.72% (43/5990) for AVEIR VR versus 0.59% (65/10 940) for Micra VR, (p = .387). The incidences of procedure-related death, cardiac perforation. cardiac arrest, emergency pericardial drainage or reparative surgery were similar for both LPMs (p > .05). Micra VR had more unacceptable thresholds requiring LPM replacement compared to AVEIR VR (95;0.9% vs. 24;0.4%; p = .001). AVEIR VR had a statistically higher incidence of device dislodgement during (32) and after (21) implant compared to Micra VR (53 (0.9%) vs. 46 (0.4%), p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Micra VR and AVEIR VR have similar procedural safety profiles, including the incidences of death and perforation. However, device problems differed significantly, possibly related to their design differences.

39356032,Adverse events related to laser fibers and laser machines during ureteroscopy and stone lithotripsy: Insights from an updated 10-year analysis of the US MAUDE database.,"Oct, 2024","INTRODUCTION: Ureteroscopy has become increasingly chosen as a treatment of choice for patients with kidney stone disease and laser as the energy source for stone lithotripsy is a key part of this. Our aim was to analyse a national database to evaluate the burden of adverse events related to laser fibers and laser machines. METHODS: Search was performed of the Manufacturer User and Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database in the United States for all events related to holmium laser fibers and holmium laser machines during ureteroscopy between 2012-2021. Information collected included the following: problem, timing, prolonged anaesthesia, early termination of procedure, injury and retained parts. RESULTS: 699 holmium laser fiber events were reported and these had been manufactured by 13 different companies. The commonest problems were breakage outside the patient while in use (26.3%) and breakage of the laser fiber tip (21.2%). Manufacturers concluded root cause to be device failure in 8.9%. 29% of issues occurred before the laser had been activated. 5.2% of cases had to be cancelled as a result of an event. Significantly more injuries were sustained intra-operatively by operating staff compared to patients (6% vs. 0.2%, p < 0.001). All these injuries were superficial burns to the skin with the hand being the most affected body part (88.1%). Zero ocular injuries were reported. Only eight events were related to laser machines and all involved sudden hardware failure but no patient injury. CONCLUSIONS: Laser fibers are fragile. Most adverse events are due to operator error.

For surgical complications, inappropriate bone resection (115/839, 13.71%) was most frequent, followed by bone/soft tissue damage (83/839, 9.89%). Notably, over-resection exceeding 2 mm (88/839, 10.49%), joint infection (25/839, 2.98%), and aseptic loosening (1/839, 0.12%) were major complications. Only two track pins related AEs were found. Moreover, the distribution of these AEs differed substantially between robot manufacturers. According to the AEs volume and AJRR data, the overall incidences of AEs related to RAKAs were calculated with 0.83% (839/100,892) between November 2010 and March 2023. CONCLUSION: Our analysis shows that while reported AEs might be increasing for RAKAs, the overall rate remains relatively low. Reassuringly, device malfunction was the most commonly AEs observed, with a minor impact on postoperative outcomes. Furthermore, our data provide a benchmark for patients, surgeons, and manufacturers to evaluate RAKA performance, though continued improvement in reducing serious AEs incidence is warranted.",No Full Text Available,adverse events related to roboticassisted knee arthroplasty a crosssectional study from the maude database,background roboticassisted surgical technique has been clinically available for decades yet realworld adverse events aes and complications associated with primary knee arthroplasty remain unclear methods in march  we searched the fda website and extracted aes related to robotic assisted knee arthroplasty raka from the maude database over the past  years the brand name function queried major robotic platforms including active and semiactive systems the overall incidence of aes was estimated based on annual surgical volume from the current american joint replacement registry ajrr two authors independently collected data on event date event type device problem and patient problem results of  eligible reports device malfunction comprised mechanical failure   and software failure   for surgical complications inappropriate bone resection   was most frequent followed by bonesoft tissue damage   notably overresection exceeding  mm   joint infection   and aseptic loosening   were major complications only two track pins related aes were found moreover the distribution of these aes differed substantially between robot manufacturers according to the aes volume and ajrr data the overall incidences of aes related to rakas were calculated with   between november  and march  conclusion our analysis shows that while reported aes might be increasing for rakas the overall rate remains relatively low reassuringly device malfunction was the most commonly aes observed with a minor impact on postoperative outcomes furthermore our data provide a benchmark for patients surgeons and manufacturers to evaluate raka performance though continued improvement in reducing serious aes incidence is warranted,adverse event related roboticassisted knee arthroplasty crosssectional study maude database background roboticassisted surgical technique clinically available decade yet realworld adverse event aes complication associated primary knee arthroplasty remain unclear method march searched fda website extracted aes related robotic assisted knee arthroplasty raka maude database past year brand name function queried major robotic platform including active semiactive system overall incidence aes estimated based annual surgical volume current american joint replacement registry ajrr two author independently collected data event date event type device problem patient problem result eligible report device malfunction comprised mechanical failure software failure surgical complication inappropriate bone resection frequent followed bonesoft tissue damage notably overresection exceeding mm joint infection aseptic loosening major complication two track pin related aes found moreover distribution aes differed substantially robot manufacturer according aes volume ajrr data overall incidence aes related rakas calculated november march conclusion analysis show reported aes might increasing rakas overall rate remains relatively low reassuringly device malfunction commonly aes observed minor impact postoperative outcome furthermore data provide benchmark patient surgeon manufacturer evaluate raka performance though continued improvement reducing serious aes incidence warranted,Robotic Surgery Malfunction Analysis
39284394,How Often Does Technology Fail in Robotic-Assisted Arthroplasty? A Comprehensive Analysis of a United States Food and Drug Administration Database.,"Sep, 2024","BACKGROUND: Robotic-assisted arthroplasty is a growing alternative to conventionally instrumented arthroplasty; however, the incidence of adverse events (AEs) associated with this technology reported to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) remains poorly quantified. The objective of this study was to categorize AEs associated with robotic-assisted arthroplasty and calculate their annual incidence as reported to the FDA. METHODS: The FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database was queried for AEs from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2021 associated with the most prevalent robotic-arthroplasty system. The AEs were calculated using national surgical numbers provided by the manufacturer and grouped by total hip arthroplasty (THA), total knee arthroplasty (TKA), or partial knee arthroplasty (PKA). RESULTS: There were 1,710 unique AEs across the study period, with 436 THA, 1,005 TKA, and 269 PKA, representing incidence rates of 0.37, 0.30, and 0.40%, respectively. All procedures demonstrated lower rates of AEs in the final year of the study, compared to the first year. Most complications were related to mechanical problems, not software issues. Surgical delays due to AEs occurred in THA (0.13% cumulative incidence, 14.0 minutes average delay), TKA (0.13%, 20.6 minutes), and PKA (0.22%, 19.4 minutes). No cases were canceled due to AEs in THA, though a few TKA (0.003%) and PKA (0.02%) cases were not performed. Patient injuries occurred in 0.05, 0.05, and 0.08% of THA, TKA, and PKA, respectively. Surgical reintervention was necessary in 0.004, 0.003, and 0.01% of THA, TKA, and PKA, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Robotic-assisted arthroplasty has a small number and relatively low rate of AEs reported to the FDA as measured through the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database, with rates steadily decreasing over the study period. Patient injury, case delay, and reoperation represent only a small fraction of the already rare AEs in the database.",No Full Text Available,how often does technology fail in roboticassisted arthroplasty a comprehensive analysis of a united states food and drug administration database,background roboticassisted arthroplasty is a growing alternative to conventionally instrumented arthroplasty however the incidence of adverse events aes associated with this technology reported to the united states food and drug administration fda remains poorly quantified the objective of this study was to categorize aes associated with roboticassisted arthroplasty and calculate their annual incidence as reported to the fda methods the fdas manufacturer and user facility device experience database was queried for aes from january   to december   associated with the most prevalent roboticarthroplasty system the aes were calculated using national surgical numbers provided by the manufacturer and grouped by total hip arthroplasty tha total knee arthroplasty tka or partial knee arthroplasty pka results there were  unique aes across the study period with  tha  tka and  pka representing incidence rates of   and  respectively all procedures demonstrated lower rates of aes in the final year of the study compared to the first year most complications were related to mechanical problems not software issues surgical delays due to aes occurred in tha  cumulative incidence  minutes average delay tka   minutes and pka   minutes no cases were canceled due to aes in tha though a few tka  and pka  cases were not performed patient injuries occurred in   and  of tha tka and pka respectively surgical reintervention was necessary in   and  of tha tka and pka respectively conclusions roboticassisted arthroplasty has a small number and relatively low rate of aes reported to the fda as measured through the manufacturer and user facility device experience database with rates steadily decreasing over the study period patient injury case delay and reoperation represent only a small fraction of the already rare aes in the database,often technology fail roboticassisted arthroplasty comprehensive analysis united state food drug administration database background roboticassisted arthroplasty growing alternative conventionally instrumented arthroplasty however incidence adverse event aes associated technology reported united state food drug administration fda remains poorly quantified objective study categorize aes associated roboticassisted arthroplasty calculate annual incidence reported fda method fda manufacturer user facility device experience database queried aes january december associated prevalent roboticarthroplasty system aes calculated using national surgical number provided manufacturer grouped total hip arthroplasty tha total knee arthroplasty tka partial knee arthroplasty pka result unique aes across study period tha tka pka representing incidence rate respectively procedure demonstrated lower rate aes final year study compared first year complication related mechanical problem software issue surgical delay due aes occurred tha cumulative incidence minute average delay tka minute pka minute case canceled due aes tha though tka pka case performed patient injury occurred tha tka pka respectively surgical reintervention necessary tha tka pka respectively conclusion roboticassisted arthroplasty small number relatively low rate aes reported fda measured manufacturer user facility device experience database rate steadily decreasing study period patient injury case delay reoperation represent small fraction already rare aes database,Robotic Surgery Malfunction Analysis

METHODS: MAUDE was analyzed for all MDRs relating to each FDA-approved ureteral stent. Event descriptions were reviewed and characterized into specific event types. Outcome measures include specific ureteral stent and reported events as detailed by the MDRs. Data is presented as number of specific event/total events. Pooled Relative risk was used to compare data. RESULTS: 2652 reports were retrieved in 10 years and a progressive rise in reported events was recorded. 831/2652 (31%) were reported as injury while 1810/2652 (68%) as malfunction of the ureteral stent and 4 events of death. The most frequently reported adverse events (AEs) were stent break (627/2652: 23%); material problems (384/2652: 14%); calcification (222/2652: 8%); difficulty to insert, advance or remove the device (155/2652: 6%).

39216717,Failure to treat ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation by implantable cardioverter-defibrillators.,"Sep, 2024","BACKGROUND: Normally functioning implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) with intact lead systems occasionally fail to deliver therapy for ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF) or deliver it only after clinically significant delays (failure-to-treat). OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate ICD failure-to-treat VT/VF in a large patient cohort. METHODS: We searched the US Food and Drug Administration's online Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database from 2019 to 2023 for manufacturer-verified reports in which normally functioning ICDs failed to treat VT/VF. RESULTS: We identified 854 reports classified as deaths (n = 96 [11.2%]), injuries (n = 585 [68.5%]), or malfunctions (n = 173 [20.3%]) for normally functioning ICDs. The most common causes were misclassification as supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) or atrial fibrillation (AF; 54.8%), undersensing (21.1%), and failure to satisfy programmed rate/duration criteria (8.7%). Most events caused by misclassification as SVT/AF (89.5%) and failure to satisfy rate/duration criteria (70.3%) were VT; most caused by undersensing were either VF (54.4%) or not specified as VT or VF (19.4%). Undersensing caused 65.6% of deaths, although it represented only 21.1% of reports. In the United States, the number of reports increased faster than that of ICD patients. CONCLUSION: In the largest reported series of failure-to-treat VT/VF by normally functioning ICDs, the most common cause was misclassification of VT as SVT/AF; the most common cause of death was undersensing of VF. Although relatively few patients with normally functioning ICDs experience failure-to-treat VT/VF, the absolute number of verified MAUDE reports suggests that more work is needed to quantify the magnitude of the problem, to identify root causes, and to develop solutions.",No Full Text Available,failure to treat ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation by implantable cardioverterdefibrillators,background normally functioning implantable cardioverterdefibrillators icds with intact lead systems occasionally fail to deliver therapy for ventricular tachycardiafibrillation vtvf or deliver it only after clinically significant delays failuretotreat objective we aimed to investigate icd failuretotreat vtvf in a large patient cohort methods we searched the us food and drug administrations online manufacturer and user facility device experience maude database from  to  for manufacturerverified reports in which normally functioning icds failed to treat vtvf results we identified  reports classified as deaths n    injuries n    or malfunctions n    for normally functioning icds the most common causes were misclassification as supraventricular tachycardia svt or atrial fibrillation af  undersensing  and failure to satisfy programmed rateduration criteria  most events caused by misclassification as svtaf  and failure to satisfy rateduration criteria  were vt most caused by undersensing were either vf  or not specified as vt or vf  undersensing caused  of deaths although it represented only  of reports in the united states the number of reports increased faster than that of icd patients conclusion in the largest reported series of failuretotreat vtvf by normally functioning icds the most common cause was misclassification of vt as svtaf the most common cause of death was undersensing of vf although relatively few patients with normally functioning icds experience failuretotreat vtvf the absolute number of verified maude reports suggests that more work is needed to quantify the magnitude of the problem to identify root causes and to develop solutions,failure treat ventricular tachycardia ventricular fibrillation implantable cardioverterdefibrillators background normally functioning implantable cardioverterdefibrillators icds intact lead system occasionally fail deliver therapy ventricular tachycardiafibrillation vtvf deliver clinically significant delay failuretotreat objective aimed investigate icd failuretotreat vtvf large patient cohort method searched u food drug administration online manufacturer user facility device experience maude database manufacturerverified report normally functioning icds failed treat vtvf result identified report classified death n injury n malfunction n normally functioning icds common cause misclassification supraventricular tachycardia svt atrial fibrillation af undersensing failure satisfy programmed rateduration criterion event caused misclassification svtaf failure satisfy rateduration criterion vt caused undersensing either vf specified vt vf undersensing caused death although represented report united state number report increased faster icd patient conclusion largest reported series failuretotreat vtvf normally functioning icds common cause misclassification vt svtaf common cause death undersensing vf although relatively patient normally functioning icds experience failuretotreat vtvf absolute number verified maude report suggests work needed quantify magnitude problem identify root cause develop solution,Uncertain
39208707,Analysis of antibiotic resistant infections associated with hirudotherapy.,"Aug, 2024","OBJECTIVE: Given rising concern regarding antibiotic resistance, our objective was to evaluate antibiotic-resistant infections following leech therapy and to characterize the use of prophylactic antibiotics. METHODS: All reports of adverse events involving hirudotherapy (product code ""NRN"") were retrieved from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration MAUDE database between 2012 and 2021. Antibiotic resistance was defined by bacterial culture or infection after antibiotic administration. RESULTS: Nineteen cases of antibiotic resistance involving hirudotherapy were identified. Only three cases of antibiotic resistance were discovered on routine testing and the remaining 16 cases were associated with patient injury. Positive blood cultures or fever were present in 26.3 % (n = 5) of cases. Cultures of the infection grew Aeromonas hydrophilia (n = 13; 68.4 %), Vibrio vulnificus (n = 3; 15.8 %), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 2; 10.5 %), and Proteus vulgaris (n = 1; 5.3 %).

PATIENTS: Patients undergoing adverse events. INTERVENTION: MAUDE database evaluation of Eustachian tube balloon dilation (ETBD) for the treatment of Eustachian tube dysfunction. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Medical device reports (MDRs) from the MAUDE database were analyzed for adverse patient events (AE) and device malfunctions (DM) among different devices for ETBD. The objective of this analysis is to assess AE rates and compare them across different devices. Sales data was also used to calculate AE rates. RESULTS: There were 18 MDRs noted in the MAUDE database for patients undergoing ETBD out of an initial 23 results. When separated into devices, the Aera had 9 total MDRs (50 %), Xpress had 8 (44.4 %) and Audion had 1 (5.6 %). There were 10 AE and 8 DM. When separated by device, Aera had 4 AEs and 5 DMs, Xpress had 5 AEs and 3 DMs, and Audion had 1 AE. The most common AE was subcutaneous emphysema (n = 4), in the head and neck region with one report of mediastinal involvement. Using this sales data, the Aera balloon has an MDR rate of 0.0128 % is established, with a rate of AE at 0.0058 %. The Audion balloon had an MDR and AE rate of 0.0164 %.

38875724,"Characterizing the safety profile of vagus nerve stimulation devices for epilepsy from 21,448 manufacturer and user reports.","Jun, 2024","OBJECTIVE: This study summarizes medical device reports (MDRs) associated with adverse events for vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) devices indicated for epilepsy as reported by the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database of the US Food and Drug Administration. METHODS: The MAUDE database was surveyed for MDRs from November 2013 to September 2022 regarding VNS devices for epilepsy. Event descriptions, device problems, correlated patient consequences, and device models were grouped and analyzed in Python. Based on event description, revision surgeries and other unique events were identified. Revenue from VNS device sales was used to approximate growth in their use over time. RESULTS: A total of 21,448 MDRs met the inclusion criteria. High VNS impedance, the most prevalent device malfunction overall (17.0% of MDRs), was the most common factor for 18 of the 102 encountered patient problems and led to 1001 revision surgeries (3371 total revisions). Included in those 18 device malfunctions were 3 of the top 6 occurring patient problems: seizure recurrence (9.9% associated with high impedance; encompassed focal, absence, and grand mal subtypes), death (1.3%), and generalized pain (7.9%). The next 4 top cited device malfunctions-lead fracture (13.7% of MDRs), operational issue (6.6%), battery problem holding charge (4.2%), and premature end-of-life indicator (2.9%)-differed widely in their percentage of cases that did not impact patients (77.4%, 57.3%, 48.9%, and 92.2%, respectively), highlighting differing malfunction severities. Seizure recurrence, the most prevalent patient impact, was the outcome most associated with 32 of the 68 encountered device problems, including high impedance (12.8%), lead fracture (12.2%), operational issue (18.4%), battery problem holding charge (31.2%), and premature end-of-life indicator (8.9%), which comprised the top 5 occurring device problems. In general, MDRs spanned a diverse range including device age, hardware, software, and surgeon or manufacturer error. Trends were seen over time with declining annual MDRs coupled with a rise in the use of VNS devices as gauged by revenue growth. Shifting device and patient problem profiles were also seen in successive models, reflecting engineering updates.

38819199,Reasons for Revision Surgery After Cervical Disk Arthroplasty Based on Medical Device Reports Maintained by the US Food and Drug Administration.,"May, 2024","STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective database review. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze revisions of CDAs reported to the MAUDE database. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Cervical disk arthroplasty (CDA) has emerged as a motion-preserving alternative to anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) for degenerative cervical disease, demonstrating comparable outcomes. Despite the availability of variable CDA designs, there is limited data on the specific complications of individual CDAs. The Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database has been used to systematically report complications associated with CDAs. However, data on specific reasons for CDA revision remains scarce. The purpose of this study is to compare common complications associated with revision for different CDAs. METHODS: The MAUDE database was queried from January 2005 to September 2023, including all nine FDA-approved CDAs. The full-text reports of each complication were categorized based on whether revision surgery was performed, the complications and the type of CDA collected and compared. RESULTS: A total of 678 revisions for nine CDAs were reported: Mobi-C (239), M6 (167), Prodisc-C (88), Prestige (60), PCM (44), Bryan (35), Secure (23), Simplify (21), and Discover (1). The top three complications associated with revision were migration (23.5%), neck pain (15.5%), and heterotopic ossification (6.6%). The most common complications per device were migration for Mobi-C (26.4%), Prodisc-C (21.3%), Prestige (24.6%), PCM (84.1%), Bryan (48.6%), Secure (30.4%), and Discover (100%). For M6, the most common complications associated with revision surgery were osteolysis (18.6%) and neck pain (18.6%), while neck pain (23.8%) was the most common for the Simplify.

Evaluation of Two Generations of Endovascular Arteriovenous Fistula Devices.,"May, 2024","BACKGROUND: In 2019, Bard Peripheral Vascular Inc (BV; now Becton, Dickinson and Company; Sparks, Maryland) received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to begin marketing the WavelinQ EndoAVF System through a process known as 510(k) authorization. Such authorization relies on BV proving that the new WavelinQ EndoAVF System was of ""substantial equivalence"" to the WavelinQ 4F EndoAVF System. We set forth to analyze patient problems and device issues reported for the new device and determine if they were significantly different from the predicate device its 510(k) approval was based on. METHODS: FDA database Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience was queried for all adverse report events for the WavelinQ EndoAVF System and WavelinQ 4F EndoAVF System. Data were collected on patient issues and device issues. Fisher's exact test was used. RESULTS: There were a total of 125 reports for the WavelinQ 4F EndoAVF System and 78 for the WavelinQ EndoAVF System. There was a significant increase in patient problem ""hypertension"" (0% vs. 5.1%; P = 0.02) for the WavelinQ EndoAVF System but a statistically significant decrease in device issue ""failure to align"" for the WavelinQ EndoAVF System (24.8% vs. 10.3%; P ≤ 0.01).

38811504,A Comprehensive Analysis of Reported Adverse Events and Device Failures Associated with Esophageal Self-Expandable Metal Stents: An FDA MAUDE Database Study.,"May, 2024","INTRODUCTION: Esophageal Stents are used to maintain esophageal lumen patency in esophageal strictures caused by intrinsic and/or extrinsic malignancies and the occlusion of concomitant esophageal fistulas. While data on the efficacy and safety of esophageal stents exist, comprehensive evaluation of adverse events is limited. The aim of this study is to investigate the reported adverse events and device failures associated with esophageal self-expandable metal stents (SEMS) using the FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. METHODS: Post-marketing surveillance data for the esophageal SEMSs were analyzed using the FDA's MAUDE database from January 2014 to December 10, 2023. The outcomes of interest were patient-related adverse events and device failures. Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel 2010 and SPSS. Pooled numbers and percentages were calculated for each adverse event. Continuous variables underwent analysis using a two-tailed student t test, and significance was set to p ≤ 0.05. RESULTS: During the study period, 548 MAUDE reports revealed 873 device failures and 186 patient-related adverse events. The most common device issues were stent activation, positioning, or separation problems (4 n = 403; 46.2%), followed by device detachment or migration (n = 109, 12.5%), and material problems (n = 93, 10.7%). Patient complications included dysphagia/odynophagia (10%), perforation, pain, and bleeding (each 7.6%). The most common device failures in over-the-wire (OTW) stents and through-the-scope (TTS) stents were activation, positioning, or separation problems (TTS: n = 183, 52.6% vs OTW: n = 220, 41.9%). Compared to OTW stents, TTS stents had higher migration and breakage (13.5% vs. 11.8%, p = 0.24), and (9.2% vs. 6.7%, p = 0.08) respectively, while OTW stents had more challenges with stent advancement or removal (5.1% vs. 0.3%, p < 0.001 and 4.6% vs 3.4%, p = 0.19, respectively) and material problems (14.7% vs. 4.6%, p < 0.001). Activation, positioning, and separation problems were the most frequent device failures in fully covered (FC) and partially covered (PC) stents (FC: n = 62, 32.8%, PC: n = 168, 43.5%). FC stents had higher migration rates (20.6% vs 9.8%, p < 0.001), while PC stents exhibited more material problems (17.4% vs. 5.8%, p < 0.001) and difficulties with advancing the stents (6.7% vs. 0%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our examination showed a prevalence of reported device complications associated with stent activation, positioning, and separation problems. Dysphagia or odynophagia emerged as the most frequently reported patient complication.

38740730,"Themes, Rates, and Risk of Adverse Events of the Artificial Pancreas in the United States Using MAUDE.","May, 2024","Three manufacturers sell artificial pancreas systems in the United States for management of Type 1 Diabetes. Given the life-saving task required of an artificial pancreas there needs to be a high level of trust and safety in the devices. This evaluation sought to find the adjusted safety event reporting rate and themes along with device-associated risk in events reported utilizing the MAUDE database. We searched device names in the MAUDE database over the period from 2016 until August 2023 (the date of retrieval). Thematic analysis was performed using dual-reviewer examination with a 96% concurrence. Relative risk (RR) was calculated for injury, malfunction, and overall, for each manufacturer, as well as adjusted event rate per manufacturer. Most events reported related to defects in the manufacturing of the casing materials which resulted in non-delivery of therapy. Tandem Diabetes Care, Inc. had an adjusted event rate of 50 per 100,000 units and RR of 0.0225. Insulet had an adjusted event rate of 300 per 100,000 units and RR of 0.1684. Medtronic has an adjusted event rate of 2771.43 per 100,000 units and RR of 20.7857. The newer Medtronic devices show improvements in likely event rate. While the artificial pancreas is still in its infancy, these event rates are not at an acceptable level for a device which can precipitate death from malfunctions. Further exploration into safety events and much more research and development is needed for devices to reduce the event rates.

38602895,"Infections Associated with Medtronic Duet External Ventricular Drains - Rhode Island Hospital, Providence, Rhode Island, January 2023-January 2024.","Apr, 2024","External ventricular drains (EVDs) are medical devices that are inserted into the ventricles of the brain to drain excess fluid, manage intracranial hypertension, monitor intracranial pressure, and administer medications. Unintentional disconnections and breaks or fractures (breaks) of EVDs or associated drainage system components can result in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage and increased risk for EVD-associated infections. After replacement of Integra Life Sciences EVD systems with Medtronic Duet EVD systems at Rhode Island Hospital in mid-September 2023, a threefold increase was observed in the prevalence of positive CSF cultures, from 2.8 per 1,000 days with an EVD in place (EVD days) during January-September 2023 to 11.4 per 1,000 EVD days during October 2023-January 2024 (rate ratio [RR] = 5.7; 95% CI = 1.5-22.0; p = 0.01) and an eightfold increase in the prevalence of infections, from 0.7 to 6.5 per 1,000 EVD days (RR = 9.8; 95% CI = 1.1-87.3; p = 0.04). An investigation by Rhode Island Hospital Infection Control during December 2023-January 2024 identified frequent reports of disconnections and breaks of the Medtronic Duet EVD system.

38580887,Adverse Events and Device Failures Associated with Pancreatic Stents: A Comprehensive Analysis Using the FDA's MAUDE Database.,"Apr, 2024","INTRODUCTION: Pancreatic duct stents (PDS) are widely used for the prevention of post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) pancreatitis. However, there is a paucity of data regarding the adverse events associated with PDS placement. This study aims to investigate the reported adverse events and device failures related to PDS, utilizing the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database maintained by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). METHODS: Post-marketing surveillance data from January 2013 to December 8, 2023, were extracted from the FDA's MAUDE database to analyze the reports pertaining to the use of commonly used PDS. The primary outcomes of interest were device issues and patient-related adverse events. Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel 2010, with the calculation of pooled numbers and percentages for each device and patient adverse event. RESULTS: A total of 579 device issues and 194 patient-related adverse events were identified. Device issues were primarily attributed to stent deformation (n = 72; 12.4%), followed by migration of the device into the pancreatic duct or expulsion out of the duct (n = 60; 10.4%), and stent fracture/breakage (n = 55; 9.4%). Among the patient-reported adverse events, inflammation was the most common (n = 26; 13.4%), followed by reports of stents becoming embedded in tissue (n = 21; 10.8%) and stent occlusion/obstruction (n = 16; 8.2%). The most prevalent device failures associated with Advanix stents were material deformation, with perforation (n = 3, 30%) being the most frequently reported adverse event. Concerning Geenen stents, migration or expulsion of the device (n = 34, 16.9%) constituted the most common device-related adverse events, while inflammation (n = 20, 16.7%) was the most frequently reported patient-related issue. For Zimmon stents, migration or expulsion of the device (n = 22, 8.8%) were the most frequently reported device-related problems, whereas perforation (n = 7, 10.9%) and bleeding (n = 7, 10.9%) were the most frequent patient-related adverse events.

The aim of this study was to characterize adverse events in anastomotic coupling devices for microvascular reconstruction. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional analysis using the 2011 to 2021 US FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. All reports of adverse events involving anastomotic coupling devices were retrieved from the MAUDE database. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze categorized events. RESULTS: There were a total of 293 documented adverse events related to anastomotic coupling devices. These adverse events resulted in 91 (31.1 %) patient injuries and 239 (81.6 %) device malfunctions. The most frequent patient problems were thrombosis/hematoma (n = 38; 41.8 %), unspecified injury (n = 31; 34.1 %), and failure to anastomose (n = 13; 14.3 %). Free flap necrosis was reported in 42 % of thrombosis/hematoma cases (n = 16). The most common malfunctions were devices operating differently than expected (n = 74; 31.0 %), connection problems (n = 41; 17.2 %), and twisted/bent material (n = 19; 7.9 %). There was no significant trend in the number of adverse events over the study period (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Adverse events from anastomotic coupling devices represent an important and modifiable factor in free tissue failure.

This study summarizes device-related adverse events associated with the AIRvance and AIRLIFT systems used for hyoid and tongue base suspension. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was queried for reports describing adverse events associated with hyoid or tongue base suspension from January 2012 to December 2022. RESULTS: 77 adverse events were identified. When performed separately, adverse events were equally as common with hyoid suspension as with tongue base suspension. More complications occurred postoperatively (51 [66.2 %]) than intraoperatively (26 [33.8 %]). The most reported adverse events were infection (23 [29.9 %]), broken screw (15 [19.5 %]), pain or discomfort (10 [13.0 %]), suture rupture (8 [10.4 %]), and dislodged screw (7 [9.1 %]). 10 infections required drainage or debridement; 12 required device explantation. CONCLUSIONS: The present study is the largest and most longitudinal review of adverse events associated with hyoid and tongue base suspension. Infection was the most common adverse event, and may require device explantation. While adverse events were most frequently attributed to device malfunction, broken screw, suture rupture, and broken needle were often attributed to operator error due to application of excessive force.

The reproducibility of a query is determined by a reproducibility coefficient that ranges from 0.95 to 1.05. This coefficient is calculated by comparing the number of medical device reports (MDRs) returned by the reproduced queries to the number of reported MDRs in the original studies. We also computed the reproducibility ratio, which is the fraction of reproducible queries in subgroups divided by the query complexity, the device category, and the presence of a data processing flow. RESULTS: As of August 8, 2022, we identified 523 articles from which 336 contained queries, and 60 of these were executable. Among these, 14 queries were reproducible. Queries using a single field like product code, product class, or brand name showed higher reproducibility (50%, 33.3%, 31.3%) compared with other fields (8.3%, P = 0.037). Single-category device queries exhibited a higher reproducibility ratio than multicategory ones, but without statistical significance (27.1% versus 8.3%, P = 0.321). Studies including a data processing flow had a higher reproducibility ratio than those without, although this difference was not statistically significant (42.9% versus 17.4%, P = 0.107). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the reproducibility of queries in MAUDE data-driven studies is limited.

38417263,Soft tissue injury events associated with neural integrity monitoring endotracheal tubes: A MAUDE database analysis.,"Feb, 2024","OBJECTIVE: Neural integrity monitoring (NIM) endotracheal tubes are widely used to provide intraoperative monitoring of the recurrent laryngeal nerve during certain neck surgeries, especially thyroidectomy, in order to reduce the risk of nerve injury and subsequent vocal fold paralysis. The unique design of NIM tubes and the increased technical skill required for correct placement compared to standard endotracheal tubes may increase the risk of upper aerodigestive tract soft tissue injury. This study aims to describe adverse events related to NIM endotracheal tubes. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional study. SETTING: The US Food and Drug Administration's MAUDE database (2010-2022); (Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience). METHODS: The MAUDE database was queried for reports of adverse events that resulted in patient soft tissue injury involving the use of endotracheal tubes approved by the Food and Drug Administration. RESULTS: There were 28 reported soft tissue injuries, with all events being related to the NIM EMG family of endotracheal tubes manufactured by Medtronic Xomed, Inc. Overall, 24 were categorized as device-related adverse events, and 4 were unspecified in the event description. The most common soft tissue injuries were edema (n = 7) and perforation (n = 7), each accounting for 25 % of adverse events. The second most common injury type was laceration (n = 4), representing 14 % of all adverse events. Overall, 9 patients (32 %) in our cohort required a surgical intervention to treat their injuries, which consisted of 6 tracheotomies and 3 instances of suture repair.

38312201,Leadless pacemaker tine damage and fracture: novel complications of a novel device fixation mechanism.,"Feb, 2024","BACKGROUND: Leadless pacemakers represent a paradigm-changing advancement. However, they required innovative and novel device design, including the use of nitinol tines for fixation. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to understand the potential for fracture in the novel tine-based fixation mechanism. METHODS: A retrospective approach was used to search the MAUDE (Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience) database for events related to Micra pacemaker tine fracture and damage. Review of each report was performed to ascertain frequency of tine fracture and damage. RESULTS: Of 4241 MAUDE reports (2104 Micra VR, 2167 Micra AV), 230 included the terms ""fracture"" or ""tine,"" which yielded 7 tine fractures and 19 reports of tine damage. Overall, 2 (29%) of 7 tine fractures were noted during implantation, whereas 2 (29%) of 7 were discovered ≥1 week after implantation; 5 (71%) of 7 tine fracture reports described no associated patient signs or symptoms, and 4 (57%) of 7 described no change in pacing parameters. Tine damage occurred during implantation in 16 (84%) of 19, compared with 2 (11%) of 19 noted ≥1 week after implantation; 15 (79%) of 19 tine damage cases reported no associated signs or symptoms, and 7 (37%) of 19 described no changes in pacing parameters.

We investigated the incidence and modes of failure of GCEs.. METHODS: Data from the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database between 2012 and 2022 were used to investigate the most common modes of failure and related adverse events with the use of GCEs. We performed analysis of 4 commonly used catheters: GuideLiner (Teleflex), Guidezilla (Boston Scientific), TrapLiner (Teleflex), and Telescope (Medtronic). The first event reported for GuideLiner was in 2012, Guidezilla in 2018, TrapLiner in 2017, and Telescope in 2019. RESULTS: During the study period, a total of 651 events were reported to the database. A total of 429 true GCE device failures were identified: 59 (14%) for GuideLiner, 297 (69%) for Guidezilla, 47 (11%) TrapLiner, and 26 (6%) for Telescope. Catheter detachment or fracture was the most frequently reported device failure for all 4 GCEs; these failures included shaft fractures, tip deformations, and collar detachments. We identified 222 reported events as unspecified adverse events; these events included device-to-device incompatibility, difficulty to advance, and device fractures outside the patient body. Only 58 (8.9%) events resulted in patient complication. Of these, coronary artery dissection was the most frequently reported complication.

38224197,Development of an Improved LASER-Resistant Endotracheal Tube.,"Jan, 2024","OBJECTIVES: Surgical fires, particularly within Otolaryngology, remain a surprisingly frequent and devastating complication of laser-related surgery in the oropharynx and airway; Current estimates suggest anywhere from 200 to 600 surgical fires per year in the United States, with 20%-30% of these occurring as a complication of laser surgery and 90%-95% of these occurring in the head and neck region. Unfortunately, the complications of laser surgery in the airway may include respiratory failure, airway burns with stenosis, and may result in mortality. The most commonly utilized endotracheal tube for protection against inadvertent laser strikes, the Laser-Shield II tube (Medtronic), was removed from the commercial marketplace in 2016 after cases of airway fires were reported as a result of feature deficiencies in the product (FDA MAUDE Database review). Since the demise of the Laser-Shield II tube, alternatives such as the Mallinckrodt laser tube and handmade reinforced tubes have been utilized, although shortcomings in design and features have made these options less appealing to practicing Otolaryngologists. Creating a laser-safe endotracheal tube is critical for safe upper airway surgery. This paper evaluates new technologies, materials, and technical innovations in endotracheal tubes that may advance patient safety in laser-assisted Otolaryngology procedures. STUDY TYPE: This paper evaluates new technologies, materials, and technical innovations in endotracheal tubes that may advance patient safety in laser-assisted Otolaryngology procedures. METHODS: First, this article reviews the background of laser surgery in Otolaryngology and the consequent risk of surgical fire with resultant development of laser-resistant endotracheal tubes and commercial availability. Next, a review of claims and national database review of product failures related to previous laser-resistant endotracheal tubes is performed through the FDA MAUDE database. This includes an evaluation of cases: review of techniques in laser airway surgery including spontaneous ventilation, decreased O RESULTS: While no iteration of a laser-resistant endotracheal tube is entirely laser safe, advances in technology can improve the safety profile of these devices. The new tube contains a double cuff, a soft and flexible shaft to minimize laryngeal insertion trauma, a smooth external surface, a tight-to-shaft balloon, and methylene blue dye in the cuff to alert the user to inadvertent penetration. These characteristics were the most requested by laryngologists in the development of a new laser-resistant tube. The newest endotracheal tube brings the features most requested by Otolaryngologists in a laser-resistant tube, and improves the safety profile over previous tubes. CONCLUSION: Development of a new endotracheal tube represents an advancement in safety for the Otolaryngologist in laser airway surgery. Understanding the previous history and the science behind surgical fire formation is essential in advancing safety for patients in the future.

38110358,Real-World Experience With the Angio-Seal Closure Device: Insights From Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database.,"Dec, 2023","PURPOSE: Angio-Seal (Terumo Medical Corporations, Somerset, New Jersey) device is indicated for femoral arteriotomy closure. Real-world published data on complications are limited. We present 1 year of safety events involving Angio-Seal from the US Food and Drug Administration's post-market surveillance database of Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE). Steps for managing frequent device-related problems are discussed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Angio-Seal MAUDE data from November 2019 to December 2020 was classified according to (1) mode of device failure, (2) complication, (3) treatment, and (4) Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe (CIRSE) adverse event classification system. RESULTS: There were 715 safety events, involving Angio-Seal VIP (93.1%), Evolution (5.7%), STS Plus (1.1%), and sizes 6F (62.5%) and 8F (37.5%). Failure mode involved unrecognized use of a damaged device (43.4%), failed deployment (20.1%), failed arterial advancement (6.3%), detachment of device component (4.9%), failed retraction (3.6%), operator error (1.1%), and indeterminate (20.6%). Of total, 44.8% of events were associated with patient harm. Complications involved minor blood loss (34.1%), hematoma (5.6%), significant blood loss (1.4%), and pseudoaneurysm (1.4%). Of total, 43.3% of cases required manual compression (MC), whereas 8.8% required more advanced intervention. Interventions included surgical repair (49.2%), thrombin injection (9.5%), balloon tamponade (6.3%), covered stent (4.8%), and unspecified (30.2%). Majority of safety events were CIRSE grade 1 (92.0%), followed by grades 2 (3.1%), 3 (4.6%), and 6 (deaths, 0.3%). Minority of devices were returned for manufacturer analysis (27.8%). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of safety events were associated with minor blood loss or local hematoma and could be addressed with MC alone. Most events were attributed to damaged device; however, very few devices were returned to manufacturer for analysis. This should be encouraged to allow for root cause analysis in order to improve safety profile of devices.

38108883,The burning truth about light therapy: a retrospective analysis of the MAUDE database on UV phototherapy and photodynamic therapy complications 2013-2023.,"Dec, 2023","INTRODUCTION: Phototherapy and photodynamic therapy (PDT) are ultraviolet light (UV) based therapies for patients with skin diseases, and are sometimes associated with potential adverse events (AE)s, including erythema, pain, pruritus, burns, and photoaging. METHODS: We investigated UV phototherapy and PDT safety using the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration's (FDA)'s Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. The MAUDE database, including medical device reports (MDR)s informed by voluntary and obligatory reporters since 1991, was searched for AEs associated with UV phototherapy and PDT 1/1/91-3/1/23. RESULTS: There were 59 UV phototherapy and 33 PDT related MDRs. Burns were the most common AE type for both phototherapy and PDT. The majority of phototherapy AEs occurred during 2021 (52.3%), and were significantly more likely to occur at home than in the clinic. Overall, 76.1% of MDRs associated with home light boxes were prescribed by online retailers, most of the MDRs (59.3%) mentioned that it is prohibited to sell phototherapy devices not prescribed by physicians, and only 8.5% noted poorly written home light box instructions. DISCUSSION: The COVID-19 pandemic prohibited in-person light treatments, and social distancing requirements may have resulted in increased frequency of home-based light treatments. Hence, while at home treatment may be easier and more accessible, in-office physician supervised UV treatments are associated with less frequent AEs. Moreover, some phototherapy MDRs reported poorly written instructions accompanying the home light box, and some PDT MDRs documented patients receiving inadequate education regarding the procedure.

38138158,LARIAT or AtriClip: Complications Profile and Comparison in Patients with Atrial Fibrillations Based on Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database.,"Dec, 2023","Heat stress (HS) poses a significant challenge to plant survival, necessitating sophisticated molecular mechanisms to maintain cellular homeostasis. Here, we identify SICKLE (SIC) as a key modulator of HS responses in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). SIC is required for the sequestration of RNA DEBRANCHING ENZYME 1 (DBR1), a rate-limiting enzyme of lariat intronic RNA (lariRNA) decay, into stress granules (SGs). The sequestration of DBR1 by SIC enhances the accumulation of lariRNAs, branched circular RNAs derived from excised introns during pre-mRNA splicing, which in turn promote the transcription of their parental genes.

37973071,Polyether Ether Ketone (PEEK) Implants and the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) Database: An Updated Review of Adverse Events and Complications.,"Nov, 2023","INTRODUCTION: Polyether ether ketone (PEEK) custom implants have been fundamental in addressing bone malformations and restoring traumatic defects within the field of craniofacial surgery. Although such implants are generally considered safe and appropriate alternatives to autologous bone grafts, there has been a lack of standardized reporting of adverse events associated with PEEK implants. The purpose of this study is multi-fold: (1) to explore the current landscape of autologous and allogeneic materials utilized for bone grafting; (2) to analyze and characterize adverse events associated within PEEK implants from the widely accredited, FDA-run database, Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE); and using the data, (3) to provide guidance to craniofacial surgeons using PEEK implants in their surgical practice. MATERIAL/METHODS: A retrospective review of the adverse events associated with PEEK implants were performed through the FDA-run database, Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE). The database was surveyed from July 2013 to January 2023. Event types were categorized by injury or malfunction, and device-reported adverse events were recorded, respectively. RESULTS: Database search initially yielded 77 adverse event reports, but after duplicates were removed, 69 event reports were included in the analysis. These events were sorted into the following categories: device-related and patient-related. Event types were categorized by injury (48.3%) or malfunction (53.6%). The most common reported device-related adverse events were ""Poor Fit"" (53.6%) and ""Adverse Event without Identified Use or Problem "" (26.1%). The most common reported patient-related event was ""Infection"" (32.8%). Of these adverse event reports, 14 (20.2%) patients required a second surgery; 21(30.4%) required implant modification whereas in the operating room; 17 (24.6%) underwent implant removal. Nine (13%) patients experienced operative case delays due to implant modifications. CONCLUSION: Infection and poor fit were among the most commonly reported adverse events associated with PEEK customizable implants. Although PEEK implants have been widely implemented in addressing craniofacial bony defects, our database analysis does call for further investigation in studying the long-term outcomes associated with PEEK craniofacial implants. With such analyses and collaboration among plastic surgeons and device engineers, there is great opportunity for innovation of these devices.",No Full Text Available,polyether ether ketone peek implants and the manufacturer and user facility device experience maude database an updated review of adverse events and complications,introduction polyether ether ketone peek custom implants have been fundamental in addressing bone malformations and restoring traumatic defects within the field of craniofacial surgery although such implants are generally considered safe and appropriate alternatives to autologous bone grafts there has been a lack of standardized reporting of adverse events associated with peek implants the purpose of this study is multifold  to explore the current landscape of autologous and allogeneic materials utilized for bone grafting  to analyze and characterize adverse events associated within peek implants from the widely accredited fdarun database manufacturer and user facility device experience maude and using the data  to provide guidance to craniofacial surgeons using peek implants in their surgical practice materialmethods a retrospective review of the adverse events associated with peek implants were performed through the fdarun database manufacturer and user facility device experience maude the database was surveyed from july  to january  event types were categorized by injury or malfunction and devicereported adverse events were recorded respectively results database search initially yielded  adverse event reports but after duplicates were removed  event reports were included in the analysis these events were sorted into the following categories devicerelated and patientrelated event types were categorized by injury  or malfunction  the most common reported devicerelated adverse events were poor fit  and adverse event without identified use or problem   the most common reported patientrelated event was infection  of these adverse event reports   patients required a second surgery  required implant modification whereas in the operating room   underwent implant removal nine  patients experienced operative case delays due to implant modifications conclusion infection and poor fit were among the most commonly reported adverse events associated with peek customizable implants although peek implants have been widely implemented in addressing craniofacial bony defects our database analysis does call for further investigation in studying the longterm outcomes associated with peek craniofacial implants with such analyses and collaboration among plastic surgeons and device engineers there is great opportunity for innovation of these devices,polyether ether ketone peek implant manufacturer user facility device experience maude database updated review adverse event complication introduction polyether ether ketone peek custom implant fundamental addressing bone malformation restoring traumatic defect within field craniofacial surgery although implant generally considered safe appropriate alternative autologous bone graft lack standardized reporting adverse event associated peek implant purpose study multifold explore current landscape autologous allogeneic material utilized bone grafting analyze characterize adverse event associated within peek implant widely accredited fdarun database manufacturer user facility device experience maude using data provide guidance craniofacial surgeon using peek implant surgical practice materialmethods retrospective review adverse event associated peek implant performed fdarun database manufacturer user facility device experience maude database surveyed july january event type categorized injury malfunction devicereported adverse event recorded respectively result database search initially yielded adverse event report duplicate removed event report included analysis event sorted following category devicerelated patientrelated event type categorized injury malfunction common reported devicerelated adverse event poor fit adverse event without identified use problem common reported patientrelated event infection adverse event report patient required second surgery required implant modification whereas operating room underwent implant removal nine patient experienced operative case delay due implant modification conclusion infection poor fit among commonly reported adverse event associated peek customizable implant although peek implant widely implemented addressing craniofacial bony defect database analysis call investigation studying longterm outcome associated peek craniofacial implant analysis collaboration among plastic surgeon device engineer great opportunity innovation device,Uncertain

37956776,Failure to defibrillate or cardiovert due to premature truncation of biphasic shocks from implantable defibrillators.,"Nov, 2023","BACKGROUND: In 2022 and 2023, Medtronic recalled implantable defibrillators because they may deliver less than full-energy shocks. The 2022 problem truncates the second phase of the waveform (SCP-T2), resulting in ∼32-J shocks, and is mitigated by downloadable software. The 2023 malfunction truncates the first phase of the waveform, resulting in 0- to 12-J shocks due to a glassed feedthrough problem (GFT-T1) that might be avoided by programming B>AX shock polarity. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the consequences of GFT-T1 and SCP-T2 shocks in the Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturers and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database and to estimate the incidences of GFT-T1 and SCP-T2. METHODS: We analyzed MAUDE reports supplemented by Medtronic data; lead failures were excluded. The incidences of SCP-T2 and GFT-T1 were estimated using USA volumes for devices with glassed feedthroughs. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-two devices delivered truncated shocks: 27 (20.5%) were GFT-T1; 103 (78.0%) were SCP-T2; and 2 (1.5%) truncated both phases (BOTH-T1&2). Of 54 ventricular fibrillation (VF) patients, 21 (38.9%) were not defibrillated by truncated shocks: 8 (38.1%) received GFT-T1 shocks, 12 (57.1%) received SCP-T2 shocks, and 1 received a BOTH-T1&2 shock; 2 patients suffered unrelated deaths; 1 was externally rescued; 1 outcome was unknown; the others were defibrillated by subsequent shocks or terminated spontaneously. The majority of patients (79.1%) shocked for ventricular tachycardia (VT) were converted, primarily (94.1%) by SCP-T2 shocks. Estimated incidences of GFT-T1 and SCP-T2 were 0.0078%-0.0088% and 0.1062%-0.1110%. CONCLUSION: GFT-T1 and SCP-T2 shocks can result in failure to terminate VF/VT, but they may be preventable.

37944306,Characterizing complications associated with skull clamps: A review of the manufacturer and user facility device experience database.,"Nov, 2023","OBJECTIVE: Head immobilization with skull clamps is a prerequisite of many neurosurgical procedures. Adverse events relating to the use of skull clamps have been reported, however, given the paucity of published reports, we sought to conduct a more comprehensive analysis using the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. METHODS: The MAUDE database was queried for neurosurgical skull clamp events over a 10-year period between January 2013 and December 2022. Reports were qualitatively analyzed and categorically assigned by the study authors as 'mechanical failure,' 'slippage,' 'contamination,' 'insufficient information,' and 'other.' Patient injury reports were also classified as 'abrasion,' 'laceration,' 'hematoma,' 'fracture,' 'intracranial hemorrhage (ICH),' 'other,' 'insufficient information,' and 'death.' RESULTS: Of 3672 reports retrieved, 2689 (73.2%) were device malfunctions, with mechanical failure (50.7%) and slippage (47.7%) being the most common causes. There were 983 reports (26.8%) involving patient injury which included lacerations (n = 776, 78.9%), fractures (n = 24, 2.4%), abrasions (n = 23, 2.3%), hematomas (n = 7, 0.71%), ICH (n = 3, 0.31%), and other causes (n = 6, 0.61%). Five (0.1%) deaths due to skull clamp related complications were also reported. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a more comprehensive picture of adverse events in neurosurgical procedures relating to the use of skull clamps. Mechanical failures of device parts were the most common device-related complication, and lacerations the most common adverse patient-related event.

37750495,Insights From the FDA's MAUDE Database Regarding the Real-World Safety of Jetstream Atherectomy for Peripheral Arterial Disease.,"Sep, 2023","INTRODUCTION: Rotational atherectomy has shown promise as an adjunctive therapy to percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and stenting for the treatment of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). However, published data regarding the safety of these devices are limited. The Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database collects reports of adverse event for medical devices. We present 3 years of MAUDE adverse events data for the Jetstream Atherectomy System (Boston Scientific) for the treatment of PAD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched MAUDE from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2021. Duplicate reports and those with insufficient information were excluded, leaving a total of 500 reports for analysis. Adverse events were categorized as either patient complication, device malfunction, or both. Adverse events were classified using the Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe's (CIRSE) classification system for adverse events. RESULTS: The most common patient complications were embolism (22; 4.4%), dissection (17; 3.4%), vessel perforation (12; 2.4%), and device fracture in the patient (6; 1.2%). The most common modes of device failure were entrapment of the device on the guidewire (134; 27%), loss of blade rotation (116; 23%), loss of aspiration (99; 20%), and mechanical damage (57; 11%). As per the CIRSE adverse events classification, most events had no post-procedural sequelae (475; 95%), followed by those requiring prolonged observation (14; 2.8%), and post-procedural therapy without long-term sequelae (10; 2.0%). One hundred six devices (21%) were returned for manufacturer analysis. CONCLUSION: We highlight important adverse events encountered in real-world practice with the Jetstream Atherectomy System. This analysis provides further understanding of the safety profile and modes of failure of Jetstream, and could help guide improvements in product design and manufacturer-user training. There is greater need for root-cause analysis that can aided by returning devices to the manufacturer. CLINICAL IMPACT: We highlight important adverse events encountered in real-world practice with the Jetstream Atherectomy System. The MAUDE database is useful for capturing and characterizing modes of device failure/malfunction not typically described in conventional clinical studies. This may provide valuable information to help guide improvements in product design and manufacturer-user training. This information could also potentially be useful in helping establish manufacturer and product liability in the setting of medicolegal claims.

37635415,Eustachian Tube Balloon Dilation: A Comprehensive Analysis of Adverse Events.,"Aug, 2023","BACKGROUND: Eustachian tube balloon dilation (ETBD) has been Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for refractory Eustachian tube dysfunction since 2016. While ETBD is generally seen as safe, the complication profile has not been well defined. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to utilize the FDA manufacturer and user facility device experience (MAUDE) database to better assess adverse events (AE) related to ETBD. METHODS: This is a study of a multiinstitutional database maintained by the U.S. FDA. A database analysis was performed via the collaboration of multiple clinicians at tertiary referral centers. The FDA MAUDE database was queried for all medical device reports (MDR) related to ETBD devices from January 2012 to November 2022. Eighty-eight unique MDR were identified, 16 of which met inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Three MDRs were classified as device-related (18.8%); none resulted in an AE. Thirteen MDRs (81.3%) were patient-related; all were classified as AEs. The most common AE was postoperative subcutaneous emphysema (n = 6, 46.2%). Of the patients with subcutaneous emphysema, there was a wide range of severity. The most severe AE (n = 1, 6.3%) was postoperative stroke secondary to carotid artery dissection.

37616552,Epidemiology of Breast Implant-Associated Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma in the United States: A Systematic Review.,"Aug, 2023","BACKGROUND: Although textured implants represent fewer than 10% of implants used in the United States, the country reports the highest incidence of breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL). OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to perform a systematic literature review on US-based epidemiology to update knowledge on BIA-ALCL in the United States. METHODS: Publications on US BIA-ALCL epidemiology were searched between September 2022 and March 2023 on MEDLINE (National Institutes of Health; Bethesda, MD), Embase (Elsevier, Amsterdam, the Netherlands), Web of Science (Clarivate, London, UK), and SCOPUS (Elsevier, Amsterdam, the Netherlands). The US numerator was obtained by averaging the FDA MAUDE database and the PSF PROFILE registry, while the denominator was estimated from chest X-rays, and included female transgender individuals. Prevalence and risk were assessed accordingly, but the incidence rate (IR) could not be updated due to the lack of available follow-up data. RESULTS: Out of 987 identified manuscripts, 10 were included. The US prevalence of BIA-ALCL in the literature ranged from 1:300 to 1:500,000 and the IR from 4.5 per 10,000 to 31.1 per 100 million persons per year. A mean value of 453.5 BIA-ALCL cases was calculated. From a denominator of 4,264,618 individuals, which includes all breast implant surfaces, we calculated 414,521 individuals with textured implants, indicating a textured prevalence of 109.4 cases per 100,000 individuals and a risk of 1:913. CONCLUSIONS: BIA-ALCL IR, prevalence, and risk has increased when calculated exclusively for patients with textured devices.

Currently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the use of balloon dilation devices produced by three manufacturers, but little is known about associated adverse events and subsequent management. STUDY DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. METHODS: Reports submitted to the FDA using the MAUDE database searched from January 2000 to July 2022 were analyzed for adverse events and management. RESULTS: A total of 13 adverse events were found in the database. Subcutaneous emphysema (n = 8) was the most common event. Other less frequent events included patulous Eustachian tube (n = 2), vascular dissection (n = 1), nasopharyngeal mucocele (n = 1), and tinnitus (n = 1). A majority of patients who experienced subcutaneous emphysema received antibiotics (n = 5) and were admitted to the hospital (n = 4). The patient with a carotid dissection 7 days postprocedure presented with a stroke and fully recovered after stent placement. There was limited preprocedure information in the MAUDE database. There were 2 patients who did not fully recover after a complication. Three patients underwent corrective surgical interventions. No one company had more associated adverse events reported.

37558289,Post-Shock Asystole in Patients Dying Out of Hospital While Wearing a Cardioverter Defibrillator.,"Aug, 2023","BACKGROUND: The wearable cardioverter-defibrillator (WCD) prevents sudden cardiac death due to ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) but does not pace for post-shock asystole (PS-A) or bradycardia (PS-B;<50 beats/ min). OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess PS-A and PS-B in patients dying out of hospital (OOH) while wearing a WCD. METHODS: The database of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Manufacturers and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) was queried for manufacturers' reports of OOH deaths while patients were wearing a WCD. Excluded were patients who did not receive a shock or were initially shocked for asystole or during resuscitation. RESULTS: From January 2017 to March 2022, 313 patients received an initial WCD shock for VF (n = 150), VT (n = 90), and non-VF/VT rhythms (n = 73). PS-A occurred in 204 patients (65.2%), and PS-B occurred in 111 (35.5%); 85 (41.7%) PS-A patients also had PS-B. Most PS-A patients (n = 185; 90.7%) had an initial shocked rhythm of VF or VT, but 19 patients (9.3%) were initially inappropriately shocked for atrial fibrillation/supraventricular tachycardia (n = 7) and idioventricular (n = 8) or sinus (n = 4) rhythm. PS-A occurred after the first WCD shock in 118 (63.8%) and after the first, second, or third shocks in 159 patients (85.9%). Seven patients had post-shock heart block. Eight patients had permanent pacemakers; 1 became nonfunctional after 1 shock, and 7 showed noncapture and/or asystole after 1 to 4 shocks. CONCLUSIONS: Post-shock asystole appears to be common in patients who die OOH after being shocked by a WCD for VF or VT. PS-A also occurs after inappropriate WCD shocks for non-VF/VT rhythms. Implanted pacemakers may not prevent PS-A after a WCD shock.

37553285,Carotid artery dissections from transcarotid artery revascularization as reported by the Food and Drug Administration.,"Aug, 2023","OBJECTIVES: Transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR) is a hybrid procedure that allows reversal of blood flow away from the brain while placing a stent through direct surgical access of the common carotid artery. It has been shown to have a lower risk of perioperative stroke compared with any prospective trial of transfemoral carotid artery stenting. However, intraoperative injuries related to the procedure and its management are not well characterized. One of the intraoperative complications seen in TCAR is iatrogenic carotid artery dissection (CD). We aim to add qualitative insight in further characterizing CDs and its management in this emerging technology. METHODS: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) maintains the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database for surveillance of all medical devices approved for use. This database was queried for all cases associated with Silk Road Medical's ENROUTE Transcarotid Neuroprotection System from September 2016 to October 2020. Case narratives related to CD were individually analyzed to determine time of injury (intraoperative, recovery, and post-discharge follow-up). CD reporting was further analyzed for the associated procedural event at the time of injury, number of access attempts to CD repair, and type of CD repair. Reports associated with CD repair were further categorized into endovascular repair and open surgical repair. RESULTS: Of the 115 unique adverse events in the database, there were 58 CDs. Most were identified intraoperatively ( CONCLUSION: CD is the most common injury related to TCAR as reported on MAUDE. The most commonly reported procedural event associated with CD was sheath placement. The rate of intraoperative endovascular and open surgical CD repair was associated with whether the access to the true lumen of the carotid artery required additional access attempts or not.

37497812,Understanding a decade of safety reporting for sacral neuromodulation in the Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database.,"Jul, 2023","INTRODUCTION: Over 350 000 sacral neuromodulation (SNM) devices have been implanted since approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1998. SNM technology and clinical applications have evolved, with minimal safety updates after initial trials. We aim to provide an updated overview of real-world SNM safety. These insights will guide informed consent, preoperative counseling, and patient expectation-setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database is a repository for medical device safety reports. We performed MAUDE categorical (1/1/98-12/31/10) and keyword (1/1/11-9/30/21) searches for ""Interstim."" A random sample of 1000 reports was reviewed and categorized by theme. To corroborate our MAUDE database analysis, a legal librarian searched the Public Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER) database, as well as Bloomberg Law's dockets database for all lawsuits related to SNM devices. RESULTS: Our search of the MAUDE database returned 44 122 SNM-related adverse events (AEs). The figure illustrates the prevalence of event categories in the random sample. The largest proportion of reports (25.6%) related to a patient's need for assistance with device use, followed by loss/change of efficacy (19.0%). Interestingly, a fall preceded issue onset in 32% of non-shock pain, 30% of lead/device migration, and 27% of painful shock reports. Our legal search revealed only four lawsuits: one for patient complications after an SNM device was used off-label, one case of transverse myelitis after implant, one for device migration or poor placement, and the fourth claimed the device malfunctioned requiring removal and causing permanent injury. CONCLUSIONS: This review confirms the real-world safety of SNM devices and very low complication rates as seen in the original clinical trials. Our findings indicate that 43.2% (95% confidence interval 40.1%-46.3%) of SNM ""complications"" are not AEs, per se, but rather reflect a need for improved technical support or more comprehensive informed consent to convey known device limitations to the patient, such as battery life. Similarly, the number of lawsuits is shockingly low for a device that has been in the market for 24 years, reinforcing the safety of the device.

While the device has proven to be safe in clinical trials, real-world data are minimal. METHODS: The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was queried for reports on the Diamondback 360® Coronary from January 2019 to January 2022. RESULTS: A total of 566 events were reported during the study period. After the exclusion of duplicate reports, the final cohort included 547 reports. The most common mode of failure was break or separation of a device part (40.4%, n = 221) mainly due to breaking in the tip of the ViperWire (66.1%), driveshaft (22.7%), or crown (12.2%). The most common vessel associated with events was the left anterior descending artery (31.4%), followed by the right coronary artery (26.9%), left circumflex (21.6%), and left main coronary artery (6.4%). The most common clinical adverse outcome was perforation (33.0%, n = 181) with 23.7% resulting in cardiac tamponade. Most perforation cases were treated by covered stent (44.2%), surgery (30.5%), stent (98%), and balloon angioplasty (9%). There were 89 (16.3%) events of death with 67% due to perforation (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our study provided a glimpse of real-world adverse outcomes and common modes of failure due to orbital atherectomy.

37478536,Airway fires in otolaryngologic surgery: A database review.,"Jul, 2023","PURPOSE: An estimated 34 % of reported operating room fires involve the airway. Despite the inherent risks in otolaryngologic surgery, education regarding prevention and management of airway fires is limited in graduate medical training. One contributing factor is a lack of reporting of such rare events in our literature. METHODS: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database was queried for reports of adverse events related to fires occurring during surgical procedures of the airway from January 1, 2010, to March 31, 2020. RESULTS: 3687 reports were identified and 49 unique reports of airway fire were included. Sustained fires were described in 16 (32.7 %) reports and 33 (67.3 %) described transient flares. 2 fires extended beyond the airway and 9 (18.4 %) were noted to have occurred at the start of the case. Fires were reported most commonly during tonsillectomy (n = 22 [44.9 %]), vocal fold excision (n = 5 [10.2 %]), and adenoidectomy (n = 4 [8.2 %]). 46 reports attributed flare initiation to a specific element of the fire triangle. 16 patient and 2 operator injuries were reported. Saline washing was utilized in 7 (14.3 %) cases overall. Patients were extubated immediately in 2 (12.5 %) of the 16 reports of sustained fires. 0 mortalities were reported.

37341672,Adverse Events and Complications Associated With Vagal Nerve Stimulation: An Analysis of the Manufacturer And User Facility Device Experience Database.,"Jun, 2023","OBJECTIVE: Drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) can have devastating consequences for patients and families. Vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) is used as a surgical adjunct for treating DRE not amenable to surgical resection. Although VNS is generally safe, it has its inherent complications. With the increasing number of implantations, adequate patient education with discussion of possible complications forms a critical aspect of informed consent and patient counseling. There is a lack of large-scale reviews of device malfunction, patient complaints, and surgically related complications available to date. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Complications associated with VNS implants performed between 2011 and 2021 were identified through a search of the United States Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer And User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) data base. We found three models on the data base, CYBERONICS, INC pulse gen Demipulse 103, AspireSR 106, and SenTiva 1000. The reports were classified into three main groups, ""Device malfunction,"" ""Patient complaints,"" and ""Surgically managed complications."" RESULTS: A total of 5888 complications were reported over the ten-year period, of which 501 reports were inconclusive, 610 were unrelated, and 449 were deaths. In summary, there were 2272 reports for VNS 103, 1526 reports for VNS 106, and 530 reports for VNS 1000. Within VNS 103, 33% of reports were related to device malfunction, 33% to patient complaints, and 34% to surgically managed complications. For VNS 106, 35% were related to device malfunction, 24% to patient complaints, and 41% to surgically managed complications. Lastly, for VNS 1000, 8% were device malfunction, 45% patient complaints, and 47% surgically managed complications.

37306231,"Surgical Fires Involving Alcohol-Based Preparation Solution, 1991-2020.","Jun, 2023","BACKGROUND: Alcohol-based skin preparations were first approved for surgical use in 1998 and have since become standard in most surgical fields. The purpose of this report is to examine incidence of surgical fires because of alcohol-based skin preparation and to understand how approval and regulation of alcohol-based skin preparations impacted trends in fires over time. METHODS: We identified all reported surgical fires resulting in patient or staff harm from 1991 through 2020 reported to the Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. We examined incidence of fires because of these preparations, trends after approval and regulation, and common causes. RESULTS: We identified 674 reports of surgical fires resulting in harm to patients and surgical personnel, in which 84 involved an alcohol-based preparation. The time-adjusted model shows that from 1996 through 2006, there was a 26.4% increase in fires followed by a 9.7% decrease from 2007 to 2020. The decrease in fires was most rapid for head and neck and upper aerodigestive tract surgeries. Qualitative content analysis revealed improper surgical site preparation as well as close proximity of surgical sites to an oxygen source as the most common causes of fires. CONCLUSION: Since FDA approval, alcohol-based preparation solutions have been associated with a significant percentage of surgical fires. Warning label updates from 2006 to 2012 coupled with increased awareness efforts of associated risks of alcohol-based surgical solutions likely contributed to the decrease in fires. Improper surgical site preparation technique and close proximity of surgical sites to oxygen continue to be risk factors for fires.

37302952,Characteristic adverse events with intra-aortic balloon pumps: An analysis of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration MAUDE database from 2016 to 2021.,"Jun, 2023","INTRODUCTION: The United States Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) dataset represents a unique source for post-market surveillance data on adverse events (AE). An analysis of AE with percutaneous mechanical circulatory support (pMCS) devices has previously been reported specifically for microaxial flow pumps. The characteristic AE for the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) have not been similarly analyzed or reported. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All events in the MAUDE dataset between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2021 were reviewed involving the Linear, Mega and Sensation devices (Datascope/Getinge, Wayne New Jersey). Data was analyzed by two authors and categorized based on AE type, date, event type and device-related or patient-related AE. RESULTS: A total of 2795 AE were reported over five years. Device malfunction (91.4 %) was the most frequent classification followed by death (5.6 %) and injury (3.0 %). Catheter deformation/fracture/leak accounted for 37.9 % of total AEs. The most common patient event categorization was asymptomatic (90.8 %). Vessel damage/hemorrhage occurred in 1.4 % of reports. Death occurred in 5.6 % of reports and was associated with cardiac arrest in 110 of 156 events. Thrombus formation was described in 1.1 % of AEs. Device optic AE were common and unique to Sensation catheters. Calibration errors were also more common with Sensation (4.6 % versus 1.3 %) compared to other models. CONCLUSIONS: Publicly reported AE with IABPs are predominantly device malfunctions without clinical sequelae. Injury, vascular damage, bleeding and thrombosis AEs are not frequent amongst reported AEs.

37267458,Analysis of Reported Adverse Events Related to Hemospray: An FDA MAUDE Database Study.,"Jun, 2023","BACKGROUND: Topical hemostatic powder is a mineral powder that forms an adherent barrier and coagulates active bleeding in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Hemospray is the first hemostatic powder approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States. Hemospray has been increasingly used to manage GI bleeding. However, data on the adverse events of hemostatic powders are lacking. Therefore, we aim to report and analyze adverse events associated with Hemospray using the FDA's ""Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience"" database. METHODS: We analyzed the postmarketing surveillance data from the FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database for Hemospray, initially known as TC-325, from June 2018 through April 2022. Results of the search were classified into device-related technical issues, patient-related adverse events and health care staff-related adverse events. RESULTS: Five hundred two medical device reporting claims were identified from June 2018 through April 2022. Seven duplicate claims were identified, and some claims included more than one event type. Therefore, there were 558 device-related problems, 28 patient-related adverse events, and 2 adverse events in health care staff members. The most common device-related problems were activation failure or failure to fire (n = 385, 70.0%) and obstruction of carbon dioxide flow (n = 121, 21.7). The most common patient-related adverse events included tissue injury or bleeding (n = 21) and perforation (n = 5).

The process to obtain adverse events and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) database that contains them are reviewed. METHODS: Tables were created in SQL Server for four CGM products (Dexcom G6, all versions of Abbott Libre, Medtronic Guardian 3, and Senseonics Eversense) containing either malfunction or injury adverse events sorted by the manufacturer's chosen product code. As the product code is not always clear (or appropriate), the causes of the events were determined from the text description of the adverse event. The resulting causes were listed in decreasing order in tables for each product and event type. RESULTS: A common effect of several event causes prevented the user from obtaining a result. Inaccuracy was also a frequent complaint. Other causes were specific to that device.

37254239,The Use and Utility of Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Data from the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database in Otology: A Systematic Review.,"May, 2023","OBJECTIVE: To review otology-related studies using the US Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database to identify the opportunities and limitations of using MAUDE. DATABASES REVIEWED: PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, SCOPUS, and EMBASE. METHODS: All studies reporting otology-related adverse events extracted from MAUDE were included from June 20, 2002, to 2022. Two reviewers independently screened abstracts, selected articles for exclusion, extracted data, and appraised studies. Critical appraisal was done according to the National Institutes of Health quality assessment tool for case series. RESULTS: The search yielded 5,645 studies, of which 8 studies met the inclusion criteria. All eight studies were case series; three evaluated cochlear implants, two evaluated osseointegrated hearing implants, and one evaluated illuminated operating microscope use. Quality assessment revealed all studies to be of poor quality. The most common domains contributing to these ratings included unclear study population, lack of consecutive participants, comparability of participants, clear and consistent outcome measures, and appropriate statistical analysis. CONCLUSION: Otology studies using the MAUDE database are of poor quality. This was primarily due to MAUDE's structural limitations as a passive surveillance system using nonstandardized free-text reports. The quality of studies also suffered from inappropriate analysis of MAUDE data, given its design.

In the present study we aim to evaluate the MAUDE database for reported complications of MIST procedures. METHODS: The database was queried using keywords: rezum, urolift, prostate embolization (PAE), transurethral needle ablation (TUNA), transurethral microwave therapy (TUMT), prostate stent and Temporarily Implanted Nitinol Device (iTIND) on 10/1/22 to extract information regarding device problems and procedure-related complications. Gupta classification system was used to stratify complications. Statistical analysis was performed to compare frequency of complications among MIST procedures. RESULTS: We found a total of 692 reports (Rezum-358, urolift-226, PAE-53, TUNA-31, TUMT-19, prostatic stent-4, and iTIND-1). Most complications related to device or users were minor (level 1 and 2) and there was no significant difference among various MIST procedures. The screen/system error was responsible for 93% and 83% aborted cases in Rezum and TUNA, respectively, and PAE showed 40% of device component detachment/fracture. Overall Urolift and TUMT were associated with statistically significant higher incidence of major (level 3 and 4) complications (23% and 21%, respectively) as compared with Rezum (7%). Most major complications needing hospitalization after Urolift included hematoma and hematuria with clots and those after Rezum included urinary tract infection and sepsis. Thirteen deaths were reported, mostly due to cardiovascular events, which were classified as not associated with the proposed treatment.

37178539,Comparing nationally reported adverse events associated with coblation vs. PlasmaBlade for tonsillectomy.,"May, 2023","OBJECTIVE(S): Coblation, or radiofrequency ablation, and pulsed-electron avalanche knife (PEAK) plasmablade are newer approaches for tonsillectomy that reduce exposure to thermal heat. This study aims to describe and compare adverse events related to these devices for tonsillectomy. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional study. SETTING: The US Food and Drug Administration's Manufacture and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. METHODS: The MAUDE database was queried for reports involving coblation devices and the PEAK plasmablade from 2011 to 2021. Data were extracted from reports pertaining to tonsillectomy with and without adenoidectomy. RESULTS: There were 331 reported adverse events for coblation and 207 for the plasmablade. For coblation, 53 (16.0 %) of these involved patients and 278 (84.0 %) were device malfunctions. Similarly for the plasmablade, 22 (10.6 %) involved patients and 185 (89.4 %) were device malfunctions. The most frequent patient-related adverse event was burn injury, which was significantly more common with the plasmablade compared to coblation (77.3 % vs. 50.9 %, respectively, p = 0.042). For both the coblator and plasmablade, the most common device malfunction was intraoperative tip or wire damage (16.9 % vs. 27.0 %, respectively, p = 0.010). The Plasmablade tip caught fire in five reports (2.7 %) with one causing burn injury. CONCLUSIONS: While coblation devices and the plasmablade have demonstrated utility in tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy, they are associated with adverse events. Plasmablade use may require greater caution for intraoperative fires and patient burn injuries compared to coblation use.

37071804,More than algorithms: an analysis of safety events involving ML-enabled medical devices reported to the FDA.,"Apr, 2023","OBJECTIVE: To examine the real-world safety problems involving machine learning (ML)-enabled medical devices. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed 266 safety events involving approved ML medical devices reported to the US FDA's MAUDE program between 2015 and October 2021. Events were reviewed against an existing framework for safety problems with Health IT to identify whether a reported problem was due to the ML device (device problem) or its use, and key contributors to the problem. Consequences of events were also classified. RESULTS: Events described hazards with potential to harm (66%), actual harm (16%), consequences for healthcare delivery (9%), near misses that would have led to harm if not for intervention (4%), no harm or consequences (3%), and complaints (2%). While most events involved device problems (93%), use problems (7%) were 4 times more likely to harm (relative risk 4.2; 95% CI 2.5-7). Problems with data input to ML devices were the top contributor to events (82%). DISCUSSION: Much of what is known about ML safety comes from case studies and the theoretical limitations of ML. We contribute a systematic analysis of ML safety problems captured as part of the FDA's routine post-market surveillance. Most problems involved devices and concerned the acquisition of data for processing by algorithms. However, problems with the use of devices were more likely to harm.

37044309,Device Failure and Adverse Events Related to Single-use and Reusable Flexible Ureteroscopes: Findings and New Insights From an 11-Year Analysis of the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database.,"Apr, 2023","OBJECTIVE: To catalog and characterize device failures and adverse events related to flexible ureteroscopes from a national database. METHODS: Search of the Manufacturer User and Facility Device Experience database was performed for all recorded events related to flexible ureteroscopes between 2012 and 2022. The following information was collected: Problem and cause, timing, complications and injury, prolonged anesthesia, and early termination of procedure. Event severity was graded using a validated tool. RESULTS: A total of 206 events were identified (reusable/single use ratio, 2.5:1). There were 20 different problem categories reported, which included image loss (26.7%), difficulty removing scope (13.6%), scope damage from basket (4.4%), detachment of scope tip (5.8%) and contamination (4.9%). Faulty device was the predominant cause for an event related to single-use scopes (86.4%); this was seldom the case for reusable (2%). Patient injury occurred in 21.8%, but these were all in reusable scopes. No deaths were reported, but major complications included complete avulsion of the ureter (3.4%) and fully entrapped scope necessitating open surgery (2.9%). While the safety profile for single-use scopes was superior, they were significantly more likely to result in early termination (71.1% vs 37.3%, P < .001).

36972147,Are all Cages Created Equal? Analysis of Cervical Cage Malfunctions Using FDA MAUDE Database.,"Mar, 2023","STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series. OBJECTIVE: To characterize failure rates of cervical cages based on manufacturer and design characteristics using the nationwide database of reported malfunctions. BACKGROUND: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) aims to ensure the safety and efficacy of cervical interbody implants postimplantation; however, intraoperative malfunctions may be overlooked. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database was queried for reports of cervical cage device malfunctions from 2012 to 2021. Each report was categorized based on the failure type, implant design, and manufacturer. Two market analyses were performed. First, ""failure-to-market share indices"" were generated by dividing the number of failures per year for each implant material by its yearly US market share in cervical spine fusion. Second, ""failure-to-revenue indices"" were calculated by dividing the total number of failures per year for each manufacturer by their approximate yearly revenue from spinal implants in the US. Outlier analysis was performed to generate a threshold value above which failure rates were defined as greater than the normal index. RESULTS: In total, 1336 entries were identified, and 1225 met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 354 (28.9%) were cage breakages, 54 (4.4%) were cage migrations, 321 (26.2%) were instrumentation-related failures, 301 (24.6%) were assembly failures, and 195 (15.9%) were screw failures. Poly-ether-ether-ketone implants had higher failure by market share indices for both migration and breakage compared with titanium. Upon manufacturer market analysis, Seaspine, Zimmer-Biomet, K2M, and LDR exceeded the failure threshold. CONCLUSION: The most common cause of implant malfunction was breakage. Poly-ether-ether-ketone cages were more likely to break and migrate compared with titanium ones.

36883997,Assessment of adverse events for a home-use intense pulsed light hair removal device using postmarketing surveillance.,"Mar, 2023","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Home-use intense pulsed light (IPL) hair removal devices are convenient for consumers. Consumer safety associated with home-use IPL devices, however, remains a subject of interest. In this descriptive analysis, we assessed the most commonly reported adverse events (AEs) for a home-use IPL device from postmarketing surveillance and qualitatively compared these with AEs from clinical studies and medical device reports of home-use IPL treatments. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this analysis of voluntary reports, we queried a distributor's postmarketing database for IPL devices for the period beginning January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2021. All sources of comments, for example, phone, e-mail, company-sponsored web sites, were included in the analysis. AE data were coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology. Also, we conducted a PubMed search to identify AE profiles from existing literature on home-use IPL devices and we searched the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database for reports on home-use IPL devices. These results were qualitatively compared to the data in the postmarketing surveillance database. RESULTS: A total of 1692 cases involving IPL were identified from voluntary reports of AEs between 2016 and 2021. The shipment-adjusted reporting rate for AE cases (number of AE cases/100,000 shipped IPL devices) was 67/100,000 during this 6-year period. The most commonly reported AEs were pain of skin 27.8% (470/1692), ""thermal burn"" 18.7% (316/1692), and erythema 16.0% (271/1692). Among the top 25 AEs reported, no unexpected health events were observed. The reported AEs were qualitatively similar to the pattern seen in clinical studies and the MAUDE database associated with such home-use IPL treatments.

36871655,Metal-Free Cortico-Pedicular Device for Supplemental Fixation in Lumbar Interbody Fusion.,"Mar, 2023","OBJECTIVE: Pedicle screw fixation is a commonly utilized adjunct for lumbar interbody fusion, yet risks include screw malposition, pullout, loosening, neurovascular injury, and stress transfers leading to adjacent segment degeneration. This report describes the preclinical and initial clinical results of a minimally invasive, metal-free cortico-pedicular fixation device used for supplemental posterior fixation in lumbar interbody fusion. METHODS: Safety of arcuate tunnel creation was evaluated in cadaveric lumbar (L1-S1) specimens. A finite element analysis study evaluated clinical stability of the device to pedicular screw-rod fixation at L4-L5. Preliminary clinical results were assessed by analysis of Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database complications, and 6-month outcomes in 13 patients treated with the device. RESULTS: Among 35 curved drill holes in 5 lumbar specimens, no breaches of the anterior cortex were identified. The mean minimum distance from the anterior surface of the hole to the spinal canal ranged from 5.1 mm at L1-L2 to 9.8 mm at L5-S1. In the finite element analysis study, the polyetheretherketone strap provided comparable clinical stability and reduced anterior stress shielding compared to the conventional screw-rod construct. The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database identified 1 device fracture with no clinical sequelae among 227 procedures. Initial clinical experience showed a 53% decrease in pain severity (P = 0.009), a 50% decrease in Oswestry Disability Index (P < 0.001), and no device-related complications.

METHODS: A retrospective review of reports to the US Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database of intrapulmonary feeding tube placements during use of an EMPD from 2019 through 2021. Complications, outcomes, operator training, interference from anatomical variations and medical devices, and the use and accuracy of radiographs in identifying pulmonary placements were recorded. RESULTS: Sixty-two cases of intrapulmonary tube placement were identified; 10 were associated with a fatal outcome. Pneumothorax occurred in 35 cases and feedings were delivered into the lung in 11 cases. User error was cited in 6 cases and was implicit in most others. Little information was provided about operator training. Four intrapulmonary placements were associated with anatomical variations and 1 with a left ventricular assist device. Radiographic follow-up was described in 28 cases and correctly identified 23 of the intrapulmonary placements. CONCLUSIONS: User error was a significant factor, which highlights the need for empirical data to clarify the amount of training needed to safely credential EMPD operators. Clearer information is needed about anatomical variations that may contraindicate use of an EMPD, as well as medical devices that may interfere with an EMPD.

36810809,Analysis of Reported Adverse Events Associated with Over-the-Scope Endoscopic Suturing System: an FDA MAUDE Database Study.,"Feb, 2023","PURPOSE: The over-the-scope endoscopic suturing system (ESS) (OverStitch™) is one of the most widely utilized endoscopic suturing systems in current clinical practice; however, data on the adverse events associated with this device is scarce. Our study aims to evaluate the adverse events and complications associated with the over-the-scope ESS using the FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the post-marketing surveillance data from the FDA MAUDE database for the over-the-scope ESS from January 2008 through June 2022. RESULTS: Eighty-three reports were filed from January 2008 to June 2022. Adverse events were classified as device-related complications and patient-related adverse events. Seventy-seven device-related issues and 87 patient adverse events were identified. The most common device-related issue was difficulty to remove after deployment (n=12, 15.58%) followed by mechanical problem (n=10, 12.99%), mechanical jam (n=9, 11.69%), or entrapment of device (n=9, 11.69%). Of the 87 patient-related adverse events, the most common was perforation (n=19; 21.84%), followed by device embedded in tissue or plaque (n=10; 11.49%), and abdominal pain (n=8; 9.20%). Of the 19 patients who experienced perforation, two required open surgical repair and one required laparoscopic surgical repair. CONCLUSION: The overall adverse events from the over-the-scope ESS remain acceptable as evidenced by the number of reported cases since 2008.

36789489,Analysis of reported adverse events of pipeline stents for intracranial aneurysms using the FDA MAUDE database.,"Feb, 2023","OBJECTIVE: Flow diverting stents (FDS) are a validated device in the treatment of intracranial aneurysms, allowing for minimally invasive intervention. However, after its approval for use in the United States in 2011, post-market surveillance of adverse events is limited. This study aims to address this critical knowledge gap by analyzing the FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database for patient and device related (PR and DR) reports of adverse events and malfunctions. METHODS: Using post-market surveillance data from the MAUDE database, PR and DR reports from January 2012-December 2021 were extracted, compiled, and analyzed with R-Studio version 2021.09.2. PR and DR reports with insufficient information were excluded. Raw information was organized, and further author generated classifications were created for both PR and DR reports. RESULTS: A total of 2203 PR and 4017 DR events were recorded. The most frequently reported PR adverse event categories were cerebrovascular (60%), death (11%), and neurological (8%). The most frequent PR adverse event reports were death (11%), thrombosis/thrombus (9%) cerebral infarction (8%), decreased therapeutic response (7%), stroke/cerebrovascular accident (6%), intracranial hemorrhage (5%), aneurysm (4%), occlusion (4%), headache (4%), neurological deficit/dysfunction (3%). The most frequent DR reports were activation/positioning/separation problems (52%), break (9%), device operates differently than expected (4%), difficult to open or close (4%), material deformation (3%), migration or expulsion of device (3%), detachment of device or device component (2%).

36788718,Facial Dermal Filler Injection and Vaccination: A 12-Year Review of Adverse Event Reporting and Literature Review.,"Feb, 2023","BACKGROUND: Following authorization of 2 COVID-19 vaccines in December 2020, media attention increased towards postvaccine adverse events (AEs) in patients with facial dermal filler injections. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to characterize vaccine-related facial dermal filler AEs by scrutinizing the FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. METHODS: The MAUDE database was queried from January 1, 2011 to January 28, 2023 for facial dermal filler medical device reports (MDRs) discussing vaccination-related AEs. A PubMed (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) literature review on dermal filler AEs was then conducted. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Of 10,637 MDRs identified, 33 were included. There were 25 MDRs (75.8%) related to COVID-19 vaccination. Hyaluronic acid-based fillers were described in 31 MDRs (93.9%). AEs were mostly reported within days postinjection (n = 7, 21.2%), but ranged from immediately (n = 2, 6.1%) to months (n = 6, 18.2%) postinjection. Most AEs were reported postvaccine (n = 17, 51.5%) vs postfiller (n = 14, 42.4%). In 26 reports (78.8%), AEs occurred at the site of filler injection. Most MDRs described inflammation/swelling (n = 21, 28.0%). The literature review returned 302 articles, of which 14 were included. Only 1 article (7.1%) was published in a plastic surgery journal. CONCLUSIONS: Although the pandemic brought attention to COVID-19 vaccine-related facial dermal filler AEs, this study shows a low incidence compared with the millions of vaccine and filler injections administered.

36728443,Adverse Events of Endoscopic Clip Placement: A MAUDE Database Analysis.,"Feb, 2023","BACKGROUND: Clips are endoscopic mechanical devices with tensile and closure strength that can approximate tissue and provide hemostasis through a tamponade effect. Clips are ubiquitously used in endoscopic practice, and numerous studies have validated the clinical efficacy of clips, with recent guidelines recommending them as a first-line intervention for recurrent and persistent nonvariceal gastrointestinal bleeding. However, the safety profile for these devices has yet to be delineated, thus, we aim to investigate this feature by examining the adverse events reported to the Food and Drug Administration. METHODS: Postmarketing surveillance data from the Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer And User Facility Device Experience database were analyzed from January 2012 to January 2021. The Manufacturer And User Facility Device Experience database is a reporting software and does not independently verify the details of complications. RESULTS: Two thousand five hundred forty reports were issued, of which 287 were patient adverse events and 2766 were device problems. Activation, separation, and positioning issues were most common. No consequences or clinically significant impact on patients were seen in 1968 reports. Foreign bodies were seen in 97 cases, hemorrhage in 57 cases, tissue damage in 42 cases, embedded clips in tissues/plaques in 16 cases, perforation in 15 cases, lacerations in 6 cases, and infection in 3 cases.

36727830,An Analysis of a Decade of Lumbar Interbody Cage Failures in the United States: A MAUDE Database Study.,"Feb, 2023","STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective case series. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the rates of lumbar interbody cage failures based on their material and manufacturer. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Perioperative lumbar interbody cage malfunctions are underreported events in the spine literature and may result in complications. Although the Food and Drug Administration ensures the safety of these devices under physiological conditions after implantation, these devices may experience nonphysiological conditions during implantation, which may be overlooked. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MAUDE database was examined for reports of lumbar cage device malfunctions from 2012 to 2021. Each report was categorized based on failure type and implant design. A market analysis was performed by dividing the total number of failures per year for each manufacturer by their approximate yearly revenue from spinal implants in the United States. Outlier analysis was performed to generate a threshold value above which failure rates were defined as greater than the normal index. RESULTS: Overall, 1875 lumbar cage malfunctions were identified. Of these, 1230 (65.6%) were cage breakages, 257 (13.7%) were instrument malfunctions, 177 (9.4%) were cage migrations, 143 (7.6%) were assembly failures, 70 (4.5%) were screw-related failures, and 21 (1.1%) were cage collapses. Of the breakages, 923 (74.9%) occurred during insertion or impaction and 97 entries detailed a medical complication or a retained foreign body. Of the migrations, 155 (88.6%) were identified postoperatively, of which 73 (47.1%) detailed complications and 52 (33.5%) required a revision procedure. Market analysis demonstrated that Medtronic, Zimmer Biomet, Stryker, Seaspine, and K2M exceeded the calculated threshold. CONCLUSIONS: Lumbar cages with polyether ether ketone core material failed more frequently by breakage, whereas titanium surface cages failed more frequently by migration. Failure rates varied depending on the manufacturer. Most cage breakages identified in the present study occurred intraoperatively during implantation. These findings call for a more detailed Food and Drug Administration evaluation of these intraoperative malfunctions before commercial approval.

36528205,Major Complications and Failure Modes of the Angiosculpt Scoring Balloon Catheter: Analysis of the MAUDE Database.,"Dec, 2022","Since its Food and Drug Administration approval in January 2007, the Angiosculpt scoring balloon catheter has been widely utilized in severely calcified stenotic vascular lesions. We sought to characterize the complication rates, failure modes, and outcomes associated with the Angiosculpt catheter. Using queried events from October 2013 to December 2020 from the Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database, we analyzed the Angiosculpt scoring balloon catheter complication rates and mode of failure. A total of 248 complications were reported. Most reported complications occurred in the superficial femoral artery (SFA) (19.4%, n = 48), followed by the left anterior descending artery (8.1%, n = 20). Severe vessel calcifications were reported in (26.6%, n = 66) of the complications. Most complications occurred with damage to the device, such as tip break (44.8%, n = 111) and balloon rupture (26.6%, n = 66).

36564288,Mortality related to the use of stapler devices and clip appliers: Analysis of the Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database.,"Dec, 2022","BACKGROUND: Surgical staplers and clip appliers are commonly used and have a potential to malfunction, which may result in serious injury or death. These events are self-reported to the Food and Drug Administration and compiled in the Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database. This study characterizes mortality related to surgical stapler and clip applier failure reported in the Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database. METHODS: The Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database was reviewed between 1992 and 2016 for medical device reports related to surgical staplers and clip appliers filed under the following product codes: GAG, FZP, GDO, GDW, KOG, and GCJ. Adverse events including death and the type of device failure were reviewed. Temporal trends in reported deaths related to device failure were analyzed and the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project database was used to adjust for annual surgical case volume using linear regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 75,415 malfunctions, 21,115 injuries, and 676 deaths were associated with the use of surgical stapler and clip applier devices. Most deaths occurred postoperatively (N = 516, 76.3%) and were due to infection/sepsis (N = 89, 17.2%) or vascular injuries (N = 110, 21.3%). Intraoperative mortality (N = 79, 11.7%) was primarily due to vascular injuries (N = 73, 92.4%). Device failures resulting in death were noted both intraoperatively (N = 268, 39.6%) and postoperatively (N = 325, 48.1%). In post hoc root cause analysis, a surgical stapler and clip applier device problem was the most common attributed cause of death (N = 238, 65.4%). In the linear regression analysis, there was a significant increase in the mortality from device failure in the study period after adjusting for annual surgical volume (P < .01).

The objective of this study is to characterize the adverse events and associated device malfunctions of reusable flexible cystoscopes and to provide information on contamination and post-procedural infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was queried for all adverse events and device malfunctions related to the use of flexible cystoscopes between January 2015 and December 2020. The MAUDE adverse event classification system was used to standardize the severity of complications and special focus was taken to identify clusters of events related to a single device. RESULTS: A total of 335 adverse events related to flexible cystoscopes were identified. Most adverse events associated with patient harm were caused by infection (n = 121), which included 19 cases of sepsis, one ICU admission, and one death. Among the infections, 29 cases showed growth of the same organism in both the device and patient. There were five infectious outbreaks identified and each outbreak was attributed to a single cystoscope. Other adverse events included mechanical malfunction (n = 6) and allergic reaction (n = 1).

36461676,Analysis of Polyethylene-Related Revisions After Total Ankle Replacements Reported in US Food and Drug Administration Medical Device Adverse Event Database.,"Dec, 2022","BACKGROUND: There are 2 general types of total ankle replacement (TAR) designs with respect to the polyethylene insert, mobile-bearing (MB) and fixed-bearing (FB) TARs. The aim of this study is to compare polyethylene-related adverse events (AEs), particularly revisions, reported for MB TARs and FB TARs using the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. METHODS: A text mining method was applied to the medical device reporting (MDR) in the MAUDE database from 1991 to 2020, followed by manual reviews to identify, characterize, and describe all polyethylene-related AEs, including revisions, reported for MB and FB TARs. RESULTS: We found 1841 MDRs for MB (STAR Ankle only) and 1273 MDRs for 40+ FB TARs approved/cleared by the FDA. For the MB design, 33% (606/1841) of the AEs reported related to the polyethylene component, compared to 24% (291/1273) of the AEs reported for FB designs. Polyethylene fractures were reported in 11.3% (208/1841) for the MB designs compared to 0.2% (2/1273) for the FB designs. Half of the polyethylene-related revisions occurred within an average of 4.1 years after implantation for the MB design compared within an average of 5.2 years for FB designs. CONCLUSION: Analysis of this database revealed a higher proportion of reported polyethylene fractures and greater need for earlier revisions for polyethylene-related issues with use of the primary MB design in the database as compared with FB TAR designs. Further study of device-related complications with more recent designs for both MB and FB ankle replacement components are needed to improve the outcomes of total ankle replacement.

36416861,Laryngology Outcomes Following Implantable Vagus Nerve Stimulation.,"Nov, 2022","IMPORTANCE: Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) devices have gained widespread acceptance for treatment of resistant epilepsy and depression. The increasing number of procedures has resulted in an increasing number of iatrogenic injuries to the vagus nerve, which can have a significant effect on vocalization and quality of life. OBJECTIVE: To determine the relative frequency of laryngeal adverse effects reported to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) after VNS implantation and to analyze associated VNS device problems. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cross-sectional analysis queried the FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database of adverse events in the US between 1996 and 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the percent of adverse events reported to the FDA that included patients who received VNS with laryngeal adverse effects and the associated proportion of device problems after VNS surgery. RESULTS: A total of 12 725 iatrogenic vagus nerve issues were documented after VNS implantation, with apnea (n = 395; 3.1%) being the most common patient problem. Overall, 187 reports of laryngeal adverse effects associated with VNS devices were identified and represented the eighth most common iatrogenic vagus nerve problem reported to the FDA. Laryngeal adverse effects included 78 reports of voice alteration and 57 reports of paresis/paralysis. The VNS device problems frequently associated with laryngeal adverse effects were high impedance (n = 15, 8.02%), incorrect frequency delivery (n = 10, 5.35%), and battery problems (n = 11, 5.88%). The number of laryngeal adverse effect reports per year peaked in 2012 with 43 cases. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cross-sectional study found that although the literature demonstrates that vocal changes occur with nearly all VNS devices, the FDA receives adverse event reports of voice changes. Our results emphasize a potential need to improve patient counseling prior to VNS surgery to better set patient expectations regarding vocal changes and to prevent unnecessary patient concern.

METHODS: We identified surgical fires that were reported to the Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database between 2000 and 2020 that resulted in patient or surgical personnel harm. Quantitative and descriptive content analyses were performed on free-text responses to identify contributing factors of surgical fire patient and personnel harm events. RESULTS: We identified 565 surgical fire events resulting in patient or surgical personnel harm over a 20-year study period (median 25 events/year; range, 8-53). Surgical fires were significantly more likely to occur during upper aerodigestive tract (unadjusted odds ratio 15.96; 95% confidence interval, 11.93-21.34) and head and neck (unadjusted odds ratio 5.47; confidence interval 4.14-7.22) procedures compared with abdomen and pelvis procedures. Upper aerodigestive tract and head and neck procedures had the highest incidence of life-threatening injury (41% and 21%, respectively).

36226833,Safe design of surgical robots - a systematic approach to comprehensive hazard identification.,"Oct, 2022","OBJECTIVES: Since the 1980s, robotic arms have been transferred from industrial applications to orthopaedic surgical robotics. Adverse events are frequent and often associated with the adopted powerful and oversized anthropomorphic arms. The FDA's 510(k) pathway encourages building on such systems, leading to the adoption of hazards, which is known as ""predicate creep"". Additionally, the methodology of hazard identification for medical device development needs improvement. METHODS: We present an approach to enhance general hazard identification and prevent hazards of predicate creep by using the integrative, scenario-based and multi-perspective Point-of-View (PoV) approach. We also present the Catalogue of Hazards (CoH) as an approach for collecting and systematising hazards for future risk analysis and robot development. RESULTS: We applied seven predefined PoVs to the use case of robotic laminectomy and identified 133 hazards, mainly coming from HMI analysis and literature. By analysing the MAUDE and recalls databases of the FDA, we were able to classify historical hazards and adopt them into the use case.

36209962,Association Between Device Type and Type IIIb Endoleaks Following Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair.,"Oct, 2022","OBJECTIVE: Endoleaks following thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) can lead to the need for re-intervention and aortic rupture. Given the recent recall of a specific thoracic stent graft type due to concerns about type IIIb endoleak (T3bE), in which blood leaks through the stent graft fabric, the aim was to characterise patterns of T3bEs among available TEVAR devices. METHODS: Reports related to thoracic stent grafts in the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database between 2010 and 2020 were reviewed. Proportional reporting ratios (PRRs) and chi squared tests were used to assess for the presence of a signal of association between device type and T3bE. A PRR > 2 and chi squared value > 4 with three or more reports overall constituted a signal of association. The institutional database of patients undergoing TEVAR for thoracic aneurysms since 2002 was also queried for T3bE. RESULTS: There were 7 328 MAUDE reports available for analysis. When analysing T3bEs in the MAUDE database, the lowest PRR was 0.36 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0 - 1.03 in Gore CTAG, nine T3bE among 1 328 reports) and the highest was 2.07 (95% CI 1.72 - 2.42 in Medtronic Valiant, 64 T3bE among 2 520 reports). The T3bE chi squared value for Medtronic Valiant was 17.3. The relationship between Medtronic Valiant and T3bE was ascertainable by MAUDE data as early as 2013. Among 542 TEVARs for an aneurysm indication at Duke University Hospital since 2002, there were eight T3bEs - all in devices with sutured on graft material. CONCLUSION: The Medtronic Valiant device met criteria for association with type IIIb endoleaks in the FDA's MAUDE database and met those criteria as early as 2013. A possible relationship between woven graft fabric and T3bEs is supported by the observation that all types of T3bE that occurred among a large number of TEVARs at the institution followed placement of grafts with sutured on woven fabric.",No Full Text Available,association between device type and type iiib endoleaks following thoracic endovascular aortic repair,objective endoleaks following thoracic endovascular aortic repair tevar can lead to the need for reintervention and aortic rupture given the recent recall of a specific thoracic stent graft type due to concerns about type iiib endoleak tbe in which blood leaks through the stent graft fabric the aim was to characterise patterns of tbes among available tevar devices methods reports related to thoracic stent grafts in the food and drug administrations fda manufacturer and user facility device experience maude database between  and  were reviewed proportional reporting ratios prrs and chi squared tests were used to assess for the presence of a signal of association between device type and tbe a prr   and chi squared value   with three or more reports overall constituted a signal of association the institutional database of patients undergoing tevar for thoracic aneurysms since  was also queried for tbe results there were   maude reports available for analysis when analysing tbes in the maude database the lowest prr was   confidence interval ci    in gore ctag nine tbe among   reports and the highest was   ci    in medtronic valiant  tbe among   reports the tbe chi squared value for medtronic valiant was  the relationship between medtronic valiant and tbe was ascertainable by maude data as early as  among  tevars for an aneurysm indication at duke university hospital since  there were eight tbes  all in devices with sutured on graft material conclusion the medtronic valiant device met criteria for association with type iiib endoleaks in the fdas maude database and met those criteria as early as  a possible relationship between woven graft fabric and tbes is supported by the observation that all types of tbe that occurred among a large number of tevars at the institution followed placement of grafts with sutured on woven fabric,association device type type iiib endoleaks following thoracic endovascular aortic repair objective endoleaks following thoracic endovascular aortic repair tevar lead need reintervention aortic rupture given recent recall specific thoracic stent graft type due concern type iiib endoleak tbe blood leak stent graft fabric aim characterise pattern tbes among available tevar device method report related thoracic stent graft food drug administration fda manufacturer user facility device experience maude database reviewed proportional reporting ratio prrs chi squared test used ass presence signal association device type tbe prr chi squared value three report overall constituted signal association institutional database patient undergoing tevar thoracic aneurysm since also queried tbe result maude report available analysis analysing tbes maude database lowest prr confidence interval ci gore ctag nine tbe among report highest ci medtronic valiant tbe among report tbe chi squared value medtronic valiant relationship medtronic valiant tbe ascertainable maude data early among tevars aneurysm indication duke university hospital since eight tbes device sutured graft material conclusion medtronic valiant device met criterion association type iiib endoleaks fda maude database met criterion early possible relationship woven graft fabric tbes supported observation type tbe occurred among large number tevars institution followed placement graft sutured woven fabric,Stent Fracture Adverse Events
36198829,"Automated insulin delivery: benefits, challenges, and recommendations. A Consensus Report of the Joint Diabetes Technology Working Group of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes and the American Diabetes Association.","Oct, 2022","A technological solution for the management of diabetes in people who require intensive insulin therapy has been sought for decades. The last 10 years have seen substantial growth in devices that can be integrated into clinical care. Driven by the availability of reliable systems for continuous glucose monitoring, we have entered an era in which insulin delivery through insulin pumps can be modulated based on sensor glucose data. Over the past few years, regulatory approval of the first automated insulin delivery (AID) systems has been granted, and these systems have been adopted into clinical care. Additionally, a community of people living with type 1 diabetes has created its own systems using a do-it-yourself approach by using products commercialised for independent use. With several AID systems in development, some of which are anticipated to be granted regulatory approval in the near future, the joint Diabetes Technology Working Group of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes and the American Diabetes Association has created this consensus report. We provide a review of the current landscape of AID systems, with a particular focus on their safety. We conclude with a series of recommended targeted actions. This is the fourth in a series of reports issued by this working group. The working group was jointly commissioned by the executives of both organisations to write the first statement on insulin pumps, which was published in 2015. The original authoring group was comprised by three nominated members of the American Diabetes Association and three nominated members of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes. Additional authors have been added to the group to increase diversity and range of expertise. Each organisation has provided a similar internal review process for each manuscript prior to submission for editorial review by the two journals.

36103654,The Patient Narrative for Breast Implant Illness: A 10-Year Review of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's MAUDE Database.,"Sep, 2022","BACKGROUND: There is growing recognition of a condition known as breast implant illness. Very little information exists about the diagnosis and natural history of breast implant illness. To better understand the patient experience, we surveyed the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database for narratives describing symptoms of breast implant illness. METHODS: The MAUDE database was queried for all reports that included breast implant illness within the patient narrative between 2010 and 2020. A review of narratives was used to identify and summarize 36 symptoms over nine symptom classes. Event year and reporting year were summarized. Hierarchical clustering analysis using centroid components was conducted on all reported breast implant illness symptoms, and a dendrogram was created to visualize clustering. RESULTS: During the study period from 2010 to 2020, there were 751 captured adverse event reports in the MAUDE database that referenced breast implant illness, with the first report submission in 2014. Of those reports, 60.6 percent were for silicone implants and 39.4 percent were for saline implants. The three most commonly reported symptom categories were neurologic [ n = 544 (72.4 percent)], followed by musculoskeletal [ n = 418 (55.7 percent)], and dermatologic [ n = 273 (36.4 percent)]. The top 10 symptoms, irrespective of category, include fatigue/weakness, numbness/tingling, brain fog, depression/anxiety, arthralgia, myalgia, headache, hair loss, gastrointestinal issues, and weight change. A hierarchical clustering analysis demonstrated that symptoms reported by patients clustered into two major groups.

36074993,Reported Events Associated With Spine Robots: An Analysis of the Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database.,"Sep, 2022","STUDY DESIGN: Cross-Sectional Analysis. OBJECTIVES: To summarize medical device reports (MDRs) between August 1, 2017 and November 30, 2021 relating to robot-assisted spine systems within the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database maintained by The Food and Drug Administration (FDA). METHODS: The MAUDE database was abstract for all MDRs relating to each FDA-approved robot-assisted spine system. Event descriptions were reviewed and characterized into specific event types. Outcome measures include specific robot-assisted spine systems and reported events as detailed by the MDRs. All data is de-identified and in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). RESULTS: There were 263 MDRs consisting of 265 reported events. Misplaced screws represented 61.5% (n = 163) of reported events. Of the 163 reported events, 57.1% (n = 93) described greater than 1 misplaced screw, 15.3% (n = 25) required return to the operating room, 8.6% (n = 14) resulted in neurologic injury, 4.3% (n = 7) resulted in dural tear, and 1.2% (n = 2) resulted in hemorrhage or bleeding. Reported events other than misplaced screws included system imprecision detected prior to screw placement (58/265, 21.9%), mechanical failure (23/265, 8.7%), and software failure (18/265, 6.8%). CONCLUSIONS: As more robot-assisted spine systems gain FDA approval and the adoption of these systems continues to grow, documenting and understanding the range of reported events associated with each ""tool"" is imperative to balancing patient safety with surgical innovation.

36071989,Exploring Adverse Events and Utilization of Topical Hemostatic Agents in Surgery.,"Sep, 2022","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This retrospective study provides preliminary qualitative assessment of the adverse events (AEs), focusing on pelvic and abdominal AEs and patient outcomes reported for three hemostatic agents used in gynecologic surgery. METHODS: Utilization rates for oxidized regenerated cellulose powder (ORC), polysaccharide powder (PSP), and fibrin sealant solution (FSS) were obtained from hospitals via the Premier Healthcare databases for all surgical procedures from January 1, 2018 to September 30, 2020. All reported cases were extracted from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database for ORC and PSP and from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database for FSS. Distributions of AEs by anatomical site (MAUDE/FAERS) and surgical procedures by specialty (Premier) were evaluated for each product. Number of cases and number and types of AEs were compared to the total utilization for each product. RESULTS: PSP was the most used product during the period analyzed (n = 126,509 uses), followed by FSS (n = 80,628 uses), and ORC (n = 41,583 uses). Distribution of surgical procedures by anatomical site varied significantly between hemostatic agents (p < 0.001). ORC was associated with more patient cases with AEs and numbers of reported AEs compared with PSP and FSS (p < 0.001). ORC was associated with higher number of infections than PSP (p < 0.001) and FSS (p < 0.001).

36055459,A Comparison of Patient and Device Issues Reported for Recalled Venous Stent Systems.,"Sep, 2022","BACKGROUND: The first two Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved stents for treatment of iliofemoral vein obstruction, Boston Scientific's Vici and BD's Venovo venous stent systems, were both recalled in early 2021 within years of entering the market. Given the recent addition of patient issues as a publicly reported variable by the FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database, we set forth to analyze adverse event reports in MAUDE to better characterize issues reported for each system. METHODS: MAUDE was queried for all adverse event reports for brands ""Vici"" and ""Venovo"" from their respective US FDA market approval dates to August 19, 2021. Reported device issues, patient issues, and interventions performed for each adverse event were compiled and compared using Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: A total of 50 unique adverse event reports were compiled for the Vici system and 341 for the Venovo system. The most common device issue reported for the Vici system was migration (48% vs. 0%; P = 0.0001) versus activation failure in Venovo (85% vs. 4%; P = 0.0001). A significantly higher proportion of Venovo reports specified no patient complications or symptoms (90% vs. 26%; P = 0.0001), with no intervention performed (89% vs. 32%; P = 0.001). A significantly higher proportion of Vici devices were extracted (8% vs. 2%; P = 0.01), required use of a new device (26% vs. 5%; P = 0.0001), and required application of a second stent within the venous stent initially placed (28% vs. 2%; P = 0.0001). The rate of intervention with balloon expansion was not significantly different between the Vici and Venovo systems (6% vs. 2%; P = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: While 2 venous stent systems were recalled simultaneously, significant differences exist between reported device issues in MAUDE and whether patient injury was involved and well described.

36128133,Deep brain stimulation for refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder: A review and analysis of the FDA MAUDE database.,"Sep, 2022","BACKGROUND: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is used as a treatment option for patients diagnosed with a form of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) that is highly resistant to conventional treatment methods. In 2009, DBS was granted a humanitarian device exemption-approval by the Food and Drug Administration after promising preliminary data. Monitoring of long-term safety data through post market surveillance of adverse events has not yet been conducted for DBS in OCD patients. This study aims to address this critical knowledge gap. METHODS: All patient- and device-related (PR; DR) reports from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2021, were downloaded and compiled from the manufacturer and user facility device experience (MAUDE) database pertaining to DBS for OCD using the product class name ""Deep Brain Stimulator For OCD."" Data in this study were examined using descriptive statistics to evaluate for frequency of reporting. RESULTS: The most frequently reported PR adverse event categories included psychiatric (40%), neurological (19%), other (14%), decreased therapeutic response (10%), and infections (10%). The most frequent DR reports were high impedance (14%), energy output problem (7%), battery problem (7%), malposition of device (7%), and improper/incorrect procedure or method (7%).

35993683,Breast Implant-Related Adverse Events During Mammography: An Assessment of the Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database.,"Aug, 2022","BACKGROUND: Adverse events arising in patients with breast implants during mammography reported by the Food and Drug Administration include implant rupture, pain, and impaired visualization. However, data supporting these claims were collected in 2004, and since, newer implant generations have been developed with overall rate of implantation increasing by 48%. OBJECTIVES: This article aims to determine the current incidence of implant-related adverse events arising during mammography. METHODS: We analyzed reports regarding silicone and saline breast implants published in the Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database between 2008 and November 2018. Search terms included ""mammogram,"" ""mammography,"" ""radiograph,"" ""breast cancer screening,"" ""breast cancer test,"" and ""x-ray."" RESULTS: Of the 20 539 implant-related adverse events available in the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database, 427 were retrieved using our search strategy and 41 were related to mammography. Thirty-five of identified cases (85.4%) reported implant rupture, of which 19 (54.3%) were confirmed by a healthcare professional, 9 (25.7%) were clinically confirmed by saline implant deflation, and 7 (20.0%) were unverified reports by patients. Sixteen ruptures (45.7%) occurred with silicone implants, whereas 19 ruptures (54.3%) occurred with saline.

35916105,"FDA MAUDE database reported adverse events on noninvasive body contouring, cellulite treatment, and muscle stimulation from 2015 to 2021.","Aug, 2022","OBJECTIVE: Noninvasive cosmetic procedures have continued to gain popularity, owing to their short, in-office treatments combined with little to no downtime. These procedures are also highly accessible, even offered at medical spas by nonphysician operators. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic also saw heightened interest in all cosmetic procedures, presumably as social distancing and stay-at-home orders allotted time and space for postop recovery. As the market for these procedures expand, a thorough understanding of potential adverse events is critical for providers to better counsel their patients on risks and expectations when obtaining informed consent. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We employed the Food and Drug Administration (FDA's) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database (http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfmaude/search.cfm), which compiles medical device reports (MDRs) for suspected injuries from device use or malfunction, submitted by manufactures and operators. We focused our query on three main categories: noninvasive body contouring, cellulite treatments, and muscle stimulation therapies that utilize electromagnetic energy. The query was performed in February 2022 using a comprehensive list of product names and manufacturers. RESULTS: The initial search yielded 827 MDRs, which were individually reviewed for duplicate reports or insufficient data. Ultimately, 723 MDRs were analyzed (660 for noninvasive body contouring, 55 for cellulite treatment, and 8 for muscle stimulation). Paradoxical hyperplasia accounted for the majority of MDRs for noninvasive body contouring, while burns and scars were most common for muscle stimulation and cellulite treatments, respectively. Of the 7-year span we surveyed, 2021 accounted for 515 of the 723 total assessed MDRs (71.2%), the majority of which were from cryolipolysis procedures.

35778250,Complications With Noninvasive Fat and Cellulite Reduction Devices: A Cross-sectional Analysis of the US Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database.,"Jul, 2022","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The US FDA mandates that manufacturers and device operators disclose medical device reports (MDRs) to monitor suspected injuries and device malfunctions by submitting information to the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. Given the rapid growth in the noninvasive fat and cellulite reduction market, it is essential that physicians be aware of associated adverse events. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the MAUDE electronic database on the FDA website, the authors performed a comprehensive search of reported complications of noninvasive fat reduction and cellulite reduction devices from January 1, 2014 to January 1, 2020 at http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfmaude/search.cfm. Medical device reports that likely represented medical adverse events from device use were included. RESULTS: The search yielded 165 MDRs, a majority submitted by patients. There were 68 MDRs reported on cryolipolysis (41.2%), 34 MDRs reported on 1,060-nm laser lipolysis (20.6%), 19 MDRs reported on high-intensity focused ultrasound (11.5%), 17 MDRs reported on vacuum-assisted subcision (10.3%), 10 MDRs reported on 1,440-nm laser-assisted subcision (6.1%), 8 MDRs reported on monopolar radiofrequency (4.8%), 6 MDRs reported on focused ultrasound (3.6%), and 4 MDRs reported for a combination infrared light, bipolar radiofrequency energy, massage, and gentle suction treatment (2.4%). CONCLUSION: It can be safely presumed that most physicians do not regularly report adverse events to the FDA; however, the MAUDE database remains the largest global repository of adverse events reported for noninvasive body contouring devices, an area that has grown tremendously over the last few years. Some MDRs may be unrelated and/or unsubstantiated, and MDRs for any given device must be correlated to the total number of procedures performed.

35771964,Development of an Inventory of Dental Harms: Methods and Rationale.,"Jul, 2022","OBJECTIVES: While adverse events (AEs) are all too prevalent, their underlying causes are difficult to assess because they are often multifactorial. Standardizing the language of dental AEs is an important first step toward increasing patient safety for the dental patient. METHODS: We followed a multimodal approach building a dental AE inventory, which included a literature review; review of the MAUDE database; a cross-sectional, self-administered patient survey; focus groups; interviews with providers and domain experts; and chart reviews. RESULTS: One hundred eight unique allergy/toxicity/foreign body response, 70 aspiration/ingestion of foreign body, 70 infection, 52 wrong site/wrong patient/wrong procedure, 23 bleeding, 48 pain, 149 hard tissue injury, 127 soft tissue injury, 91 nerve injury, 171 other systemic complication, and 177 other orofacial complication were identified. Subtype AEs within the categories revealed that allergic reaction, aspiration, pain, and wrong procedure were the most common AEs identified among known (i.e., chart reviews) and hypothetical (i.e., interviews) sources. CONCLUSIONS: Using a multimodal approach, a broad list of dental AEs was developed, in which the AEs were classed into 12 categories.

35698284,Complications of Endobronchial Valve Placement for Bronchoscopic Lung Volume Reduction: Insights From the Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE).,"Jun, 2022","BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced emphysema experience breathlessness due to impaired respiratory mechanics and diaphragm dysfunction. Bronchoscopic lung volume reduction (BLVR) is a minimally invasive bronchoscopic procedure done to reduce hyperinflation and air trapping, promoting atelectasis in the targeted lobe and allowing improved respiratory mechanics. Real-world data on safety and complications outside of clinical trials of BLVR are limited. METHODS: We queried the US Food and Drug Administrations (FDA) Manufacturers and User Device Experience database from May 2019 to June 2020 for reports involving BLVR with endobronchial valve (EBV) placement. Events were reviewed for data analysis. RESULTS: We identified 124 cases of complications during BLVR with EBV implantation. The most-reported complication was pneumothorax (110/124, 89%), all of which required chest tube placement. A total of 54 of these cases (54/110, 49%) were complicated by persistent air leak requiring additional interventions. Repeat bronchoscopy was needed to remove the valves in 28 patients, 12 were discharged with a Heimlich valve, and 10 had an additional pleural catheter placed. The other complications of BLVR with EBV placement included respiratory failure (6/124, 5%), pneumonia (4/124, 3%), hemoptysis (2/124, 1.6%), valve migration (1/124, 1%), and pleural effusion (1/124, 1%). A total of 14 deaths were reported during that year. CONCLUSION: Pneumothorax is the most-reported complication for BLVR with EBV placement, and in 65% of cases, pneumothorax is managed without removing valves. Importantly, 14 deaths were reported during that timeframe.

35727630,Adverse Events Associated With Image-Guided Sinus Navigation in Endoscopic Sinus Surgery: A MAUDE Database Analysis.,"Jun, 2022","OBJECTIVE: The utilization of image-guided navigation during endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) has increased significantly since its introduction. However, the most common associated complications are still unknown. This study describes and analyzes adverse events related to image-guided ESS. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis. SETTING: The Food and Drug Administration's 2018-2022 MAUDE database (Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience). METHODS: The MAUDE database was searched for all reports on adverse events involving sinus navigation systems used in ESS from 2018 to 2022. Reported events were reviewed and categorized. RESULTS: During the study period, there were 1857 adverse events from 1565 reports, which were divided into device-related (n = 1834, 98.8%) and patient-related (n = 23, 1.2%) complications. The most common device-related complications were nonfunctionality of the system (n = 512, 27.9%), device imprecision (n = 427, 23.3%), and device sensing problems (n = 277, 15.1%). The most common patient-related complications were cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak (n = 14, 60.9%), intracranial injury (n = 4, 17.4%), and bleeding/hemorrhage (n = 3, 13.1%). Imprecision was associated with increased risk of navigation abortion by the surgeon (odds ratio, 1.50 [95% CI, 1.38-1.65]; P < .001) and increased risk of CSF leak (odds ratio, 16.5 [95% CI, 3.66-74.0]; P < .001) as compared with other device-related complications. CONCLUSIONS: The most commonly reported device- and patient-related adverse events associated with image-guided sinus navigation systems were device nonfunction, imprecision, device sensing difficulties, and CSF leak.

35536679,Complications Reported to the Food and Drug Administration: A Cross-sectional Comparison of Urogynecologic Meshes.,"May, 2022","IMPORTANCE: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration uses the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database to evaluate the safety of urogynecologic meshes; however, reports on individual meshes have not been characterized. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to compare complications among available urogynecologic meshes reported to the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database. STUDY DESIGN: This study is a cross-sectional analysis of medical device reports (MDRs) of urogynecologic mesh from January 2004 to March 2019, using the Reed Tech Navigator (LexisNexis), which codes MDRs. The percentage of reports containing specific complaints (not an adverse event rate) were compared with χ 2 tests with Dunn-Sidak correction. Correlations with time on market, mesh weight, stiffness, and porosity were determined. RESULTS: The 34,485 reports examined included 6 transvaginal meshes, 4 sacrocolpopexy meshes, and 10 midurethral slings. Most reported events were pain, erosion, and infection. For transvaginal prolapse, less than 10% of Uphold Lite (Boston Scientific) reports contained pain or erosion versus greater than 90% of Prolift/Prolift+M (Ethicon, P < 0.001). For sacrocolpopexy mesh, greater than 90% of Gynemesh (Ethicon; Prolift in vaginal form) reports included erosion and pain versus less than 60% for Artisyn (Ethicon), Restorelle (Colpoplast), and Upsylon (Boston Scientific, P < 0.0001). For slings, Gynecare TVT Obturator had the highest proportion of erosion and pain complaints. Heavier sling meshes had more reports. When Ascend (Caldera Medical), an outlier with only 5 reports, was excluded, transvaginal mesh stiffness correlated strongly with number of reports. For transvaginal meshes, number of reports correlated with time on market (ρ = 0.8, P = 0.04).

35421039,Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Reporting of Events Related to Transvaginal Mesh: Understanding the Data.,"Apr, 2022","OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine potential bias in reports to the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database involving vaginal mesh by identifying the party submitting the report, the nature of the complaints, and whether the reports were edited. METHODS: All reports submitted to the MAUDE database involving synthetic transvaginal mesh from January 2000 through December 2017 (40,266 safety reports) were identified. A random 2% sample (900) of these reports was reviewed in depth to determine the specific relevant details, including reporter type (patient, manufacturer, lawyer) and details of the complaint/injury. RESULTS: Of the 40,226 reports to MAUDE identified, 28,473 (70.7%) were sling reports, and 11,793 (29.3%) described mesh products augmenting pelvic organ prolapse repair. Of the 900 reports reviewed in depth, 46%, 41%, 10%, and 2% of entries were reported by the manufacturer, attorney, health care provider, and patients, respectively. In the 4 years after submission, 18.6% of reports were modified at least once. CONCLUSIONS: The MAUDE database allows physicians, manufacturers, and patients to immediately report adverse events experienced due to medical devices.

35379535,Device-related complications during renal cryoablation: insights from the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database.,"Apr, 2022","INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Cryoablation offers a treatment option for small renal masses ideally suited ≤3 cm. In well-selected candidates, it is associated with less perioperative morbidity compared to more invasive options, such as partial or radical nephrectomy. However, little is known regarding device-related complications associated with the procedure. We provide an analysis of reports on renal cryoablation from the Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. METHODS: Reports on renal cryoablation submitted to the MAUDE database from 2015 through 6/2021 were analyzed. Cases not pertaining to renal cryoablation were excluded (n = 33). Reports were examined to identify patient morbidity related to a potential device malfunction, as well as manufacturer assessment. Complications were graded based on an established MAUDE complication-reporting stratification. Fisher's Exact test was utilized to analyze for associations between device-related adverse events and severity of post-treatment sequelae. RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty-nine unique cases were identified. Adverse events were related to issues with the needles or system (212 cases), technical error (12 cases), or complication related to patient or tumor complexity (14 cases). There were 187 (78.6%) minor complications (MAUDE 1-2) and 52 (21.4%) major complications (MAUDE 3-4). The manufacturer performed formal device review in 164 (68.6%) cases, accepting responsibility for malfunction in 41. Notable MAUDE 3 complications included 29 (12.1%) cases aborted due to instrument/system malfunction and 14 (5.9%) cases of hemorrhage requiring a subsequent procedure. All 3 reported patient deaths (MAUDE 4) appeared to be a consequence of poor baseline health. On statistical analysis, major complications were seen in a significantly higher proportion of non-device related adverse events compared to device related events (85.2% vs. 13.7%, P < .001). CONCLUSION: While renal cryoablation is associated with low overall perioperative morbidity, there is a diverse set of device-related and procedural complications reported in recent years. Device-related adverse events were often associated with minor complications, and major complications were often seen in higher risk patients with comorbidities, more complex tumors, and after technical error. These findings highlight the need for standardized reporting of complications, optimized patient selection and counseling to ensure the best outcomes.",No Full Text Available,devicerelated complications during renal cryoablation insights from the manufacturer and user facility device experience maude database,introduction and objectives cryoablation offers a treatment option for small renal masses ideally suited  cm in wellselected candidates it is associated with less perioperative morbidity compared to more invasive options such as partial or radical nephrectomy however little is known regarding devicerelated complications associated with the procedure we provide an analysis of reports on renal cryoablation from the food and drug administration manufacturer and user facility device experience maude database methods reports on renal cryoablation submitted to the maude database from  through  were analyzed cases not pertaining to renal cryoablation were excluded n   reports were examined to identify patient morbidity related to a potential device malfunction as well as manufacturer assessment complications were graded based on an established maude complicationreporting stratification fishers exact test was utilized to analyze for associations between devicerelated adverse events and severity of posttreatment sequelae results two hundred and thirtynine unique cases were identified adverse events were related to issues with the needles or system  cases technical error  cases or complication related to patient or tumor complexity  cases there were   minor complications maude  and   major complications maude  the manufacturer performed formal device review in   cases accepting responsibility for malfunction in  notable maude  complications included   cases aborted due to instrumentsystem malfunction and   cases of hemorrhage requiring a subsequent procedure all  reported patient deaths maude  appeared to be a consequence of poor baseline health on statistical analysis major complications were seen in a significantly higher proportion of nondevice related adverse events compared to device related events  vs  p   conclusion while renal cryoablation is associated with low overall perioperative morbidity there is a diverse set of devicerelated and procedural complications reported in recent years devicerelated adverse events were often associated with minor complications and major complications were often seen in higher risk patients with comorbidities more complex tumors and after technical error these findings highlight the need for standardized reporting of complications optimized patient selection and counseling to ensure the best outcomes,devicerelated complication renal cryoablation insight manufacturer user facility device experience maude database introduction objective cryoablation offer treatment option small renal mass ideally suited cm wellselected candidate associated le perioperative morbidity compared invasive option partial radical nephrectomy however little known regarding devicerelated complication associated procedure provide analysis report renal cryoablation food drug administration manufacturer user facility device experience maude database method report renal cryoablation submitted maude database analyzed case pertaining renal cryoablation excluded n report examined identify patient morbidity related potential device malfunction well manufacturer assessment complication graded based established maude complicationreporting stratification fisher exact test utilized analyze association devicerelated adverse event severity posttreatment sequela result two hundred thirtynine unique case identified adverse event related issue needle system case technical error case complication related patient tumor complexity case minor complication maude major complication maude manufacturer performed formal device review case accepting responsibility malfunction notable maude complication included case aborted due instrumentsystem malfunction case hemorrhage requiring subsequent procedure reported patient death maude appeared consequence poor baseline health statistical analysis major complication seen significantly higher proportion nondevice related adverse event compared device related event v p conclusion renal cryoablation associated low overall perioperative morbidity diverse set devicerelated procedural complication reported recent year devicerelated adverse event often associated minor complication major complication often seen higher risk patient comorbidities complex tumor technical error finding highlight need standardized reporting complication optimized patient selection counseling ensure best outcome,Medical Device Safety Incidents
35352830,Cancer Risk Associated with Continuous Positive Airway Pressure: A National Study.,"Mar, 2022","OBJECTIVE: In 2021 the U.S. FDA issued a Class 1 safety recall notice for specific devices due to a risk of carcinogen exposure. The objective of this study was to evaluate reports of cancer linked to CPAP devices to understand implications for the field of sleep medicine. METHODS: Cases of cancer involving CPAP devices were retrieved from the MAUDE database from 2014 to 2021 and analyzed with descriptive statistics. RESULTS: A total of 2571 patient injuries were associated with CPAP. Reports of cancer (n = 209; 4.62%) were the second most commonly documented patient problem associated with CPAP, although 1950 (43.13%) patients had a device problem without an associated injury. Of the 209 cancer cases associated with CPAP, 200 (95.7%) of the adverse event reports were received by the FDA in 2021. There were 174 (9.15%) descriptions of the CPAP polyurethane sound abatement foam degrading in association with a cancer diagnosis, but degradation was more commonly not associated with malignancy (n = 1728; 90.85%). Other frequently documented CPAP device problems included broken devices (n = 279; 6.92%), fire (n = 182; 4.51%), and patient-device incompatibility (n = 144; 3.57%). CONCLUSION: Malignancy associated with CPAP devices has been reported; however, future studies are required to establish causation. Given 95.7% of those documented cases were reported in 2021, otolaryngologists should be prepared to discuss the risks of carcinogenesis associated with CPAP.

35314290,Adverse Events Associated With Robotic-Assisted Joint Arthroplasty: An Analysis of the US Food and Drug Administration MAUDE Database.,"Mar, 2022","BACKGROUND: The use of robotic assistance in arthroplasty is increasing; however, the spectrum of adverse events potentially associated with this technology is unclear. Improved understanding of the causes of adverse events in robotic-assisted arthroplasty can prevent future incidents and enhance patient outcomes. METHODS: Adverse event reports to the US Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database involving robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty (THA), total knee arthroplasty (TKA), and partial knee arthroplasty were reviewed to determine causes of malfunction and related patient impact. RESULTS: Overall, 263 adverse event reports were included. The most frequently reported adverse events were unexpected robotic arm movement for TKA (59/204, 28.9%) and retained registration checkpoint for THA (19/44, 43.2%). There were 99 reports of surgical delay with an average delay of 20 minutes (range 1-120). Thirty-one cases reported conversion to manual surgery. In total, 68 patient injuries were reported, 7 of which required surgical reintervention. Femoral notching (12/36, 33.3%) was the most common for TKA and retained registration checkpoint (19/28, 67.9%) was the most common for THA. Although rare, additional reported injuries included femoral, tibial, and acetabular fractures, MCL laceration, additional retained foreign bodies, and an electrical burn. CONCLUSION: Despite the increasing utilization of robotic-assisted arthroplasty in the United States, numerous adverse events are possible and technical difficulties experienced intraoperatively can result in prolonged surgical delays. The events reported herein seem to indicate that robotic-assisted arthroplasty is generally safe with only a few reported instances of serious complications, the nature of which seems more related to suboptimal surgical technique than technology.

35239289,Analysis of Complications in Sacroiliac Joint Fusions Using FDA 510(k) Cleared Devices.,"Mar, 2022","STUDY DESIGN: This was a level III-retrospective cohort study. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to present an unbiased report of the current rate of severe complications for Federal Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) cleared sacroiliac joint (SIJ) fusions and investigate the underlying cause of these complications. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The number of yearly SIJ fusions is on an upward trend. Currently, the most utilized implants to fuse the SIJ have been FDA 510(k) cleared devices. Studies reporting on complications following SIJ fusions are mostly industry-sponsored. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was searched for all reported FDA 510(k) cleared SIJ fusion device complications. Several data points were obtained from each report and recorded. The Hospital Inpatient National Statistics and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) was also searched for the number of SIJ fusions performed each year. RESULTS: A search of the MAUDE database returned 1115 reports, with the first report on June 30, 2011, and the last report on July 28, 2020. Patient injury was the most common type of event reported at 97.5% (1080/1107). Death was reported in 3 patients (0.3%). Malposition was the most common device problem at 49.5% (548/1107). The root cause of these events was primarily user error at 58.2% (644/1107). Revision surgery or reoperation occurred in 92.8% (1028/1107) of reports. Data for SIJ fusions through CMS showed an overall trend of increasing yearly SIJ fusions. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of complications reported to MAUDE for FDA 510(k) cleared SIJ fusion devices are user error due to improper placement of implants. These complications are likely underreported, and there is currently no formal tracking system of total SIJ fusions performed to calculate accurate complication and revision rates.

35210113,Breaking it down: Review and management of sialendoscopy device malfunctions.,"Feb, 2022","PURPOSE: The present study was aimed at determining common causes of sialendoscopy device malfunctions and identifying a uniform algorithm to manage device failures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was searched for various keywords related to sialendoscopy. Reports between the dates of December 1, 2009 to March 31, 2020 were downloaded for review and included in the study. Variables such as: device, the iatrogenic injury type, and subsequent surgical or medical intervention were collected and details of the malfunction were categorized based on the type of malfunction. RESULTS: 206 medical device reports were identified; 47 of them which met inclusion criteria (106 were duplicate cases and 53 were irrelevant to the present study). The majority of device malfunctions involved salivary stone extractor baskets (SSEBs), (40/47; 85.1%), followed by malfunctions of balloon dilators (3/47; 6.4%) and sialendoscopes (2/47; 4.3%). Retention of the SSEB was noted in 85% of the SSEB malfunctions.

35140755,FDA MAUDE database analysis of titanium middle ear prosthesis.,"Feb, 2022","PURPOSE: Partial ossicular replacement (PORP) and total ossicular replacement prostheses (TORP) are used to restore ossicular chain function. Despite favorable auditory outcomes, these interventions have associated risks and complications. This study examines the FDA MAUDE database for ossicular chain prosthesis adverse events to highlight complications, interventions, and root cause analysis (RCA) findings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MAUDE database was searched for Medical Device Reports (MDRs) relating to PORPs and TORPs from 2010 to 2020. MDR event descriptions were reviewed, and adverse events were identified as a device issue, patient issue, and/or packaging issue that occurred intraoperatively or postoperatively. RESULTS: Our search identified 70 MDRs which included 110 reported adverse events. Events consisted of 63 device issues, often due to device breaks and displacements, 39 patient issues, including common complaints of hearing loss and erosion, and 8 packaging issues. When comparing PORPs and TORPs, TORPs had more reported device issues whereas PORPs had more packaging issues. Intraoperative device issues were commonly resolved by completing the procedure with a backup device and most postoperative device issues required additional surgery. For devices returned to the manufacturer, RCA determined that most breaks were caused by modification and/or mishandling or that the product met specifications with an undetermined cause for the break. CONCLUSION: Device issues were the most common adverse events and frequently required subsequent intervention. Displacement occurred more often with TORPs and was associated with changes in hearing or erosion.

35059533,Devices for esophageal function testing.,"Jan, 2022","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Esophageal function testing is an integral component of the evaluation of refractory GERD and esophageal motility disorders. This review summarizes the current technologies available for esophageal function testing, including the functional luminal imaging probe (FLIP), high-resolution esophageal manometry (HRM), and multichannel intraluminal impedance (MII) and pH monitoring. METHODS: We performed a MEDLINE, PubMed, and MAUDE database literature search to identify pertinent clinical studies through March 2021 using the following key words: esophageal manometry, HRM, esophageal impedance, FLIP, MII, and esophageal pH testing. Technical data were gathered from traditional and web-based publications, proprietary publications, and informal communications with pertinent vendors. The report was drafted, reviewed, and edited by the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Technology Committee and approved by the Governing Board of the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. RESULTS: FLIP is a high-resolution impedance planimetry system used for pressure and dimension measurement in the esophagus, pylorus, and anal sphincter. FLIP provides complementary information to HRM for esophageal motility disorders, especially achalasia. The Chicago classification, based on HRM data, is a widely adopted algorithmic scheme used to diagnose esophageal motility disorders. MII detects intraluminal bolus movement and, combined with pH measurement or manometry, provides information on acid and non-acid gastroesophageal reflux and bolus transit in patients with refractory GERD and for preoperative evaluation for anti-reflux procedures.

34953099,Leadless pacemaker perforations: Clinical consequences and related device and user problems.,"Dec, 2021","BACKGROUND: Cardiac perforation during leadless pacemaker implantation is more likely to require intervention than perforation by a transvenous lead. This study reports the consequences of Micra pacemaker perforations and related device and operator use problems based on information the manufacturer has submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). METHODS: FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was searched for Micra perforations. Data extracted included deaths, major adverse clinical events (MACEs), and device and/or operator use problems. RESULTS: Between 2016 and July 2021, 563 perforations were reported within 30 days of implant and resulted in 150 deaths (27%), 499 cardiac tamponades (89%), 64 pericardial effusions (11%), and 146 patients (26%) required emergency surgery. Half of perforations were associated with 139 (25%) device problems, 78 (14%) operator use problems, and 62 (11%) combined device and operator use problems. Inadequate electrical measurements or difficult positioning were the most frequent device problems (n = 129); non-septal implants and perforation of other structures were the most frequent operator use problems (n = 69); a combined operator use and device problem resulted in 62 delivery system perforations. No device or operator use problem was identified for 282 perforations (50%), but they were associated with 78 deaths, 245 tamponades, and 57 emergency surgeries.

34889828,Adverse Events Associated With Ossicular Prostheses: Utility of a Federal Database.,"Dec, 2021","OBJECTIVES: Ossicular prostheses have demonstrated utility in ossicular chain reconstruction, but their use also is associated with complications. This study aims to explore the utility of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database for the systematic analysis of complications associated with ossicular prostheses. It also summarizes adverse events to patients (AEPs) and device malfunctions (DMs) reported in the MAUDE database, and attempts to examine the consequences brought about by these events and to identify likely root causes. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of the MAUDE database. METHODS: The MAUDE database was queried for reports from January 2010 to May 2020. Data were extracted from reports involving the use of ossicular prostheses. RESULTS: Seventy-three medical device reports, reports submitted to the Food and Drug Administration detailing suspected device-associated malfunctions, injuries, and deaths, involved ossicular prostheses and were included for analysis, from which 126 adverse events were extracted. Of these, 50 (39.7%) were AEPs, while 76 (60.3%) were DMs. The most common AEPs were foreign body and hearing loss, while the DMs reported most commonly were broken prosthesis and displaced prosthesis. Of the 76 DMs, 19 (25%) were attributed to mishandling by the operator, while 6 (7.9%) were due to a defective device. Broken prosthesis was the DM most commonly attributed to mishandling by the operator in 16 (32.7%) cases. CONCLUSION: Ossicular prostheses are used extensively for ossicular chain reconstruction, but also are associated with adverse events.

34750929,Adverse events related to AtriCure EPi-Sense Coagulation Device-Analysis of the FDA MAUDE database.,"Nov, 2021","INTRODUCTION: The AtriCure EPi-Sense Device is used for the hybrid convergent procedure, an emerging treatment for persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) and long-standing persistent AF. However, data on the AE related to the EPi-Sense device are scarce. METHODS: Keyword ""EPI-SENSE"" was searched on the MAUDE database. There were 80 device reports from 2016 to 2020. After excluding reports when the device was not returned for evaluation, 79 device reports were included for final analysis. RESULTS: The adverse events (AE) were broadly classified into 11 categories. The most common complications were pericardial effusion (25.3%), stroke (17.7%), and atrioesophageal fistula (AEF) (8.9%). Death was reported in 15 (19%) cases, 3 of which were due to pulmonary embolism, 6 due to AEF, 3 due to unknown cause, 1 due to sepsis, 2 due to events related to acute renal failure. DISCUSSION: Pericardial effusion is a common AE reported in patients with convergence procedures and is well documented in the CONVERGE trial. The convergent procedure is unique in that the epicardial ablations are performed on the posterior wall with the radiofrequency probe directed towards the heart and away from the esophagus which in theory should reduce esophageal injuries. Despite that, a high number of AEF were noticed. Finally, there were also some reports of saline perfusion malfunction which can lead to injuries due to overheating.

34842892,Renewing the Call for Reforms to Medical Device Safety-The Case of Penumbra.,"Nov, 2021","IMPORTANCE: Strengthening premarket and postmarket surveillance of medical devices has long been an area of focus for health policy makers. The recent class I recall (the most serious of the US Food and Drug Administration [FDA] recalls) of reperfusion catheters manufactured by Penumbra, a US-based medical device company, illustrates issues of device safety and oversight that mandate attention. OBJECTIVES: To review the regulatory history and clinical evidence of the Penumbra JET 7 Reperfusion Catheter with Xtra Flex Technology (JET 7) and use the device recall as a case study of the challenges associated with clinical evaluation, transparency, and oversight of medical devices in the US. EVIDENCE: Regulatory history and clinical evidence for the Penumbra medical devices were analyzed through a qualitative review of decision letters in the Access FDA database for medical devices and medical device reports in the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database and a review of market data (eg, earnings calls, company communications) and clinical literature. FINDINGS: The JET 7 device was subjected to a class I recall following more than 200 adverse event reports, 14 of which involved patient deaths. Regulatory analysis indicated that each of the Penumbra reperfusion catheters was cleared under the 510(k) pathway (which allows devices to be authorized with limited to no clinical evidence), with limited submission of either new clinical or animal data. Clinical evidence for Penumbra devices was generated from nonrandomized, single-arm trials with small sample sizes. The regulatory issues raised by JET 7 are reflective of broader challenges for medical device regulation.

34610901,Adverse Events Following Transcatheter Edge-to-Edge Repair (TEER) Using MitraClip: Lessons Learned From the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) Registry.,"Oct, 2021","OBJECTIVE: The MitraClip from Abbott is FDA approved intracardiac implantable device for transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER). Despite a few previously published studies, there is limited safety data for its use in clinical practice, hence, we designed this study using data obtained from a safety nationwide database to demonstrate the safety profile of MitraClip. METHODS: The first two of the five authors independently queried all reported adverse events from the United State Food and Drug Administration [FDA] Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience [MAUDE] registry from January 2014 to December 2020. The primary end point was trend in reported fatal events obtained from this database. The secondary end points included the causes of reported nonfatal reports from the MAUDE registry. The trend of reported fatal events was assessed using the Cochran Armitage trend test over the period of the study. RESULTS: During the study period, subjects included 3370 patients whose MitraClip-associated adverse events were reported and captured by MAUDE registry. Of these, 211 were fatal and 3159 nonfatal events. Fatal event reports resulted deaths and reported nonfatal events were from injuries and device system malfunction. This study demonstrated an initial upward trend from 2014 to 2015 then a subsequent statistically significant downward trend in reported fatal events from 2015 to 2020 (Cochran-Armitage test P = 0.039). The peak proportion of reported fatal events occurred in 2015, (n = 44; representing 1.25% of reported adverse events) and lowest proportion of reported fatal events took place in 2020 (n = 19; representing 0.56% of reported adverse events). The most reported nonfatal events were from malfunctioning of MitraClip system (n = 1170; representing 37% of reported nonfatal events), new unremarkable repolarization abnormalities on periprocedural EKG (n = 864; representing 27% of reported nonfatal events), leaflet rupture (n = 651; representing 21% of reported nonfatal events), and cardiogenic shock (n = 170; representing 5% of reported nonfatal events). CONCLUSIONS: This analysis of the MAUDE Registry indicated, especially within the confines of this study's limitations and poor data quality of information, an apparent downward trend of reported fatal events over the study period. Even though conclusive attributions cannot be made regarding this important finding, perhaps, this points to early evidence of a potential institutional or operator learning curve with this device.

34513401,Characterizing Adverse Events of Cranioplasty Implants After Craniectomy: A Retrospective Review of the Federal Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database.,"Sep, 2021","Introduction Cranioplasty is performed by placing an artificial plate in place of a patient's native skull bones to repair post-craniectomy defects after trauma. Implanted materials can range from titanium to synthetic polyether derivatives and are produced by multiple manufacturers. There are few studies characterizing complications associated with these cranioplasty plates to date. We aimed to quantify and categorize complications of these devices using a national federal database. Methods The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was queried for all entries reported under the category ""plate, cranioplasty, preformed, non-alterable"" with the additional product code GXN between the time range from September 1, 2010, to September 1, 2020. After data extraction, each of the entries was screened for duplicates and tabulated into different categories of complications. Additionally, product information such as the plate manufacturer was extracted from each entry. Results The search yielded 329 unique event reports. The most frequent complications were infection (39%), followed by incorrectly fitting implants (30%) and implant breaks (6%). Other major complications included cerebrospinal fluid leakage and cerebral edema (5%), wound dehiscence (5%), and migration of hardware (3%). The brands associated with the most entries in the database were the Synthes (DePuy Synthes Companies, Massachusetts, United States) polyetheretherketone (PEEK) patient-specific implants (PSI) (57%), the Biomet (Zimmer Biome, Indiana, United States) hard tissue replacement-polyetherketoneketone (HTR-PEKK) patient-matched implant (PMI) (23%), and the AccuShape PEEK PSI (MedCAD, Dallas, USA) (5%).

34508038,Ultrasonic Device Complications in Endodontics: An Analysis of Adverse Events From the Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience.,"Sep, 2021","OBJECTIVES: The author conducted a study to determine the frequency and types of adverse events associated with endodontic ultrasonic devices as reported to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. METHODS: Endodontic ultrasonic device-related adverse events reported to the MAUDE database from January 1, 2016, to October 31, 2020, were accessed and reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 1258 adverse event reports were submitted to the FDA MAUDE database, as classified under FDA product code ELC (ultrasonic scaler) during the study period. Among these reports, 403 were specific to the dedicated use of the 2 main types of ultrasonic devices used in endodontic treatment: ultrasonic tip devices and irrigation-related devices. Device malfunction-associated events, consisting primarily of device breakage, comprised 393 of the 1258 adverse event reports, whereas the remaining 10 reports were identified as being patient injury-related reports. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency, root causes, and economic costs of ultrasonic tip device breakage remain largely unstudied.

34346023,Bent or broken: analysis of set screw fracture in the TFNa implant.,"Aug, 2021","OBJECTIVES: To evaluate set screw fracture in the Trochanteric Femoral Nail Advanced implant (TFNa, Synthes, West Chester, PA) and to identify additional mechanisms of set screw failure in the TFNa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who had experienced failure after open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) with the TFNa were identified. TFNa implants were explanted and inspected following revision surgery. Medical device reports (MDRs) and manufacturer's inspection reports describing similar failures for the TFNa in the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database were also reviewed. RESULTS: Four set screw fractures that occurred at a level II trauma center were observed. Sixty-seven reported failures were identified in the MAUDE database for review. Twenty-eight failed implants were returned to the manufacturer for inspection with a published inspection report available for analysis. Set screw fractures can occur in the TFNa when the set screw is deployed prematurely into the proximal screw aperture prior to blade/screw insertion. The set screw can also bend and deform if it is advanced against a helical blade/lag screw that is not fully seated into position, thereby potentially compromising its function. CONCLUSION: The TFNa set screw allows for potential fracture during implant insertion leading to uncontrolled collapse, early excessive proximal femoral shortening, and rotational instability of the helical blade/lag screw.

34309680,"What Is Being Reported About Vaginal ""Lasers""?: An Examination of Adverse Events Reported to the Food and Drug Administration on Energy-Based Devices.","Jul, 2021","BACKGROUND: A description of energy-based genitourinary non-surgical devices (energy-based devices) safety data is outlined given their rapid adoption. OBJECTIVES: The authors sought to describe adverse events for energy-based devices in the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database and to compare with similar devices and other subspecialty applications. We hypothesized that products with genitourinary applications had similar adverse events to dermatologic or general surgery applications. METHODS: The authors used Reed Tech Navigator to compile adverse events reports for all registered energy-based devices. Individual adverse events reports associated with (1) non-ablative, (2) fractionated, (3) unfractionated, (4) radiofrequency, and (5) hybrid laser technologies were categorized. Adverse event characteristics were compared among genitourinary applications (n = 39) and other subspecialty applications within the same devices (n = 79). RESULTS: Eighteen manufacturers were identified, which collectively manufacture 43 products with genitourinary applications. Thirty-nine genitourinary adverse events were reported and isolated to 6 manufacturers with 11 products, of which 82% (n = 32) were injuries, 15% (n = 6) were device malfunction, and 3% (n = 1) were related to improper maintenance. Local treatment reactions were the most commonly reported injury (62%, n = 21). Adverse events varied by device type, with CO2 lasers having more burns and radiofrequency devices having higher rates of sensation loss. Comparing similar technology types, genitourinary energy-based devices had the fewest adverse events reports per device in the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database. CONCLUSIONS: Adverse events were reported for one-quarter of the products currently available, and most were local treatment reactions. The reporting of adverse events is equal to that of other subspecialties, suggesting similar risk profiles.

34309624,Reporting of Death in US Food and Drug Administration Medical Device Adverse Event Reports in Categories Other Than Death.,"Jul, 2021","IMPORTANCE: In the US, most postmarket medical device safety data are obtained through adverse event reports that are submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. Adverse event reports are classified by the reporter as injury, malfunction, death, or other. If the device may have caused or contributed to a death, or if the cause of death is unknown, the FDA requires that the adverse event be reported as a death. OBJECTIVE: To determine the percentage of medical device adverse event reports submitted to the MAUDE database that were not classified as death even though the patient died. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this study, a natural language processing algorithm was applied to the MAUDE database, followed by manual text review, to identify reports in the injury, malfunction, other or missing categories that included at least 1 term that suggested a patient death, such as patient died or patient expired, from December 31, 1991, to April 30, 2020, for any medical device. EXPOSURES: Manual review of a random sample of 1000 adverse event reports not classified as death and of selected reports for 62 terms that are associated with deaths but were not classified as death. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Percentage of adverse event reports in which the patient was said to have died in the narrative section of the report but the reporter classified the report in a category other than death. RESULTS: The terms in the natural language processing algorithm identified 290 141 reports in which a serious injury or death was reported. Of these, 151 145 (52.1%) were classified by the reporter as death and 47.9% were classified as malfunction, injury, other, or missing. For the overall sample, the percentage of reports with deaths that were not classified as deaths was 23% (95% CI, 20%-25%), suggesting that approximately 31 552 reports in our sample had deaths that were classified in other categories. The overall percentage of missed deaths, defined as the percentage of deaths that were classified in other categories, was 17% (95% CI, 16%-19%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Many of the findings of this study suggest that many medical device adverse event reports in the FDA's MAUDE database that involved a patient death are classified in categories other than death. As the FDA only routinely reviews all adverse events that are reported as patient deaths, improving the accuracy of adverse event reporting may enhance patient safety.",No Full Text Available,reporting of death in us food and drug administration medical device adverse event reports in categories other than death,importance in the us most postmarket medical device safety data are obtained through adverse event reports that are submitted to the us food and drug administration fdas manufacturer and user facility device experience maude database adverse event reports are classified by the reporter as injury malfunction death or other if the device may have caused or contributed to a death or if the cause of death is unknown the fda requires that the adverse event be reported as a death objective to determine the percentage of medical device adverse event reports submitted to the maude database that were not classified as death even though the patient died design setting and participants in this study a natural language processing algorithm was applied to the maude database followed by manual text review to identify reports in the injury malfunction other or missing categories that included at least  term that suggested a patient death such as patient died or patient expired from december   to april   for any medical device exposures manual review of a random sample of  adverse event reports not classified as death and of selected reports for  terms that are associated with deaths but were not classified as death main outcomes and measures percentage of adverse event reports in which the patient was said to have died in the narrative section of the report but the reporter classified the report in a category other than death results the terms in the natural language processing algorithm identified   reports in which a serious injury or death was reported of these    were classified by the reporter as death and  were classified as malfunction injury other or missing for the overall sample the percentage of reports with deaths that were not classified as deaths was   ci  suggesting that approximately   reports in our sample had deaths that were classified in other categories the overall percentage of missed deaths defined as the percentage of deaths that were classified in other categories was   ci  conclusions and relevance many of the findings of this study suggest that many medical device adverse event reports in the fdas maude database that involved a patient death are classified in categories other than death as the fda only routinely reviews all adverse events that are reported as patient deaths improving the accuracy of adverse event reporting may enhance patient safety,reporting death u food drug administration medical device adverse event report category death importance u postmarket medical device safety data obtained adverse event report submitted u food drug administration fda manufacturer user facility device experience maude database adverse event report classified reporter injury malfunction death device may caused contributed death cause death unknown fda requires adverse event reported death objective determine percentage medical device adverse event report submitted maude database classified death even though patient died design setting participant study natural language processing algorithm applied maude database followed manual text review identify report injury malfunction missing category included least term suggested patient death patient died patient expired december april medical device exposure manual review random sample adverse event report classified death selected report term associated death classified death main outcome measure percentage adverse event report patient said died narrative section report reporter classified report category death result term natural language processing algorithm identified report serious injury death reported classified reporter death classified malfunction injury missing overall sample percentage report death classified death ci suggesting approximately report sample death classified category overall percentage missed death defined percentage death classified category ci conclusion relevance many finding study suggest many medical device adverse event report fda maude database involved patient death classified category death fda routinely review adverse event reported patient death improving accuracy adverse event reporting may enhance patient safety,Uncertain

While potentially life-changing for individuals with Parkinson's disease, characterization of adverse events for these DBS devices have not yet been systematically organized. Therefore, the goal of this study was to characterize reported complications of DBS devices reported to the Food & Drug Administration over the last 10 years. Methods The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was utilized to retrieve entries reported under ""Stimulator, Electrical, Implanted, For Parkinsonian Symptoms"" between July 31, 2010 and August 1, 2020. After removing duplicate entries, each unique adverse event reported was sorted into complication categories based on the entries' provided narrative description. A final tabulation of complications was generated. Results The search query revealed 221 unique adverse events. The most common DBS devices were the Vercise Gevia, Vercise Cartesia and Vercise PC produced by Boston Scientific (Brian Walker, Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA, USA). The most commonly reported complications were infection (16.2%) follow by lead migrations (8.6%). Other common causes of complications were circuit-related impedance (6.5%), cerebral bleeds (6.3%), device failure (6.3%) and device-related trauma (4.5%). Over a third (40%) of all devices reported with adverse events required returning to the operating room for explant or revision.

38770130,A Descriptive Analysis of Capsule Endoscopy Events in the FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) Database.,"Jun, 2021","INTRODUCTION: The malfunction of capsule endoscopy (CE) devices is a significant reason for the failure of CE procedures, which could hinder and prevent diagnosis. Unfortunately, malfunction-related adverse events (AEs) caused by CE devices are rarely reported in publications. Although most malfunction-related AEs could not lead to physical harm, they could reduce the efficiency of medical care and increase medical costs. The manufacturer and user facility device experience (MAUDE) database, a publicly accessible resource for patient safety, contains not only the common complications of CE but also valuable malfunction-related AEs, which have been underutilized. Therefore, the study aims to discover and analyze the possible AEs associated with CE and demonstrate the utility of the MAUDE reports to promote patient safety. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We acquired MAUDE reports of CE systems from January 01, 2008, to July 31, 2020, through a systematic search strategy. We utilized the manufacturers, brand names, and product codes as search terms from which medical device reports including structured data and narrative texts were extracted, followed by a manual review of the narrative texts, reporter occupation, device involved, event type and the phase of the event; finally, patient outcomes were recorded and analyzed as per CE categories and characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 377 CEs medical device reports were retrieved, and 342 reports were included after reviewing. There were 327 mandatory reports (96%) and 15 voluntary reports (4%). These reports referred to capsule endoscope ( CONCLUSION: MAUDE serves as an invaluable data source for investigating malfunction-related AEs.

Recent behavioral endocrinology research has focused on how the brain dynamically responds to - and may even produce - sex steroids, but the gonadal tissues that primarily release these hormones receive much less attention as a potential mediator of behavioral variation. This Commentary revisits mechanisms by which the reproductive hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis can be modulated specifically at the gonadal level. These mechanisms include those that may allow the gonad to be regulated independently of the HPG axis, such as receptors for non-HPG hormones, neural inputs and local production of conventional 'neuropeptides'. Here, I highlight studies that examine variation in these gonadal mechanisms in diverse taxa, with an emphasis on recent transcriptomic work. I then outline how future work can establish functional roles of gonadal mechanisms in reproductive behavior and evaluate gonad responsiveness to environmental cues. When integrated with neural mechanisms, further investigation of gonadal hormone regulation can yield new insight into the control and evolution of steroid-mediated traits, including behavior.",No Full Text Available,response to adverse events and complications associated with intrathecal drug delivery systems insights from the manufacturer and user facility device experience maude database,gonadal sex steroid hormones are wellstudied modulators of reproductive physiology and behavior recent behavioral endocrinology research has focused on how the brain dynamically responds to  and may even produce  sex steroids but the gonadal tissues that primarily release these hormones receive much less attention as a potential mediator of behavioral variation this commentary revisits mechanisms by which the reproductive hypothalamicpituitarygonadal hpg axis can be modulated specifically at the gonadal level these mechanisms include those that may allow the gonad to be regulated independently of the hpg axis such as receptors for nonhpg hormones neural inputs and local production of conventional neuropeptides here i highlight studies that examine variation in these gonadal mechanisms in diverse taxa with an emphasis on recent transcriptomic work i then outline how future work can establish functional roles of gonadal mechanisms in reproductive behavior and evaluate gonad responsiveness to environmental cues when integrated with neural mechanisms further investigation of gonadal hormone regulation can yield new insight into the control and evolution of steroidmediated traits including behavior,response adverse event complication associated intrathecal drug delivery system insight manufacturer user facility device experience maude database gonadal sex steroid hormone wellstudied modulators reproductive physiology behavior recent behavioral endocrinology research focused brain dynamically responds may even produce sex steroid gonadal tissue primarily release hormone receive much le attention potential mediator behavioral variation commentary revisits mechanism reproductive hypothalamicpituitarygonadal hpg axis modulated specifically gonadal level mechanism include may allow gonad regulated independently hpg axis receptor nonhpg hormone neural input local production conventional neuropeptides highlight study examine variation gonadal mechanism diverse taxon emphasis recent transcriptomic work outline future work establish functional role gonadal mechanism reproductive behavior evaluate gonad responsiveness environmental cue integrated neural mechanism investigation gonadal hormone regulation yield new insight control evolution steroidmediated trait including behavior,Uncertain

34151665,Complications associated with deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease: a MAUDE study.,"Jun, 2021","INTRODUCTION: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a common surgical option for the treatment of medically refractory Parkinson's disease (PD). Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE), a United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-compiled database of adverse event reports related to medical devices, is a public resource that can provide insight into the relative frequency of complications and patient complaints. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We accessed the MAUDE database and queried for adverse reports for deep brain stimulators implanted for PD from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2018. Complaints were classified into device malfunction, patient non-compliance, patient complaint, surgically managed complications (i.e. complications that are corrected via surgery), and death. Patient complaints were further stratified into ineffective stimulation, shock, overstimulation, battery-related problems, or pain at the pulse generator site. Surgically managed complications were classified as intraoperative complications, impedance, migration, erosion, infection, lead fracture, and lead disconnection. Each event could receive multiple classifications and subclassifications. RESULTS: A total of 4,189 adverse event reports was obtained. These encompassed 2,805 patient complaints. Within this group, 797 (28%) events were classified as ineffective stimulation. There were 1,382 surgically managed complications, 104 (8%) of which were intraoperative complications, 757 (55%) documented impedance issues, 381 (28%) infections, and 413 (30%) lead-related issues. There were 53 documented deaths. CONCLUSIONS: The MAUDE database has potential use as a real time monitor for elucidating the relative occurrence of complications associated with deep brain stimulation. It also allows for the analysis of device-related complications in specific patient populations.

34117494,Evolution of a novel technology for gastroesophageal reflux disease: a safety perspective of magnetic sphincter augmentation.,"Jun, 2021","Magnetic sphincter augmentation using the LINX® device is a minimally invasive surgical option for patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease. An estimated 30,000 devices have been implanted worldwide. Device removals and erosion are identified risks. The objective of this analysis is to explore the procedure evolution with an emphasis on the removals and associated characteristics that may guide future clinical practice. The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience and Ethicon's complaint databases were queried for all surgical device explants since January 2013. Device unit sales were used to determine the rates. The endpoint was based upon the time from implant to explant. Explant and erosion rates were calculated at yearly intervals and the Kaplan-Meier estimator was used to measure the time to explant. Chi-square analyses were used to investigate the risk of explant associated with the size, geography and implant year. Overall, 7-year cumulative risk of removal was 4.81% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) CI: 4.31-5.36%). The likelihood of removal was significantly related to the device size (P < 0.0001), with smaller sizes being more likely to be explanted. The primary reasons for device removal and relative percentages were dysphagia/odynophagia (47.9%), persistent gastroesophageal reflux disease (20.5%) and unknown/other (11.2%). Overall, the 7-year cumulative risk of erosion was 0.28% (95% CI: 0.17-0.46%). The average device size increased from 14.2 beads ± 1.0 in 2013 to 15.3 beads ± 1.2 in 2019 (P < 0.001).

34052127,Complications and Failure Modes of Covered Coronary Stents: Insights From the MAUDE Database.,"May, 2021","BACKGROUND: Data on the mechanisms of failure of covered coronary stents [Graftmaster, PK Papyrus] are limited. METHODS: We queried the ""Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience"" (MAUDE) database between August 2018 (when the PK Papyrus stent was FDA approved) and December 2020 for reports on covered coronary stents. RESULTS: We identified 299 reports in the MAUDE database (after excluding duplicates, peripheral vascular reports, and incomplete records) (Graftmaster n = 225, PK Papyrus n = 74). The most common mechanism of failure of covered stents was failure to deliver the stent (46.2%), followed by stent dislodgement (22.4%) and failure to seal the perforation (19.7%). Failure to deliver the stent was more often reported with Graftmaster compared with PK Papyrus (59.1% vs. 6.8%, p < 0.001). Stent dislodgement was more often reported with PK Papyrus compared with Graftmaster (75.7% vs. 4.9%, p < 0.001) and was managed by device retrieval or by crushing the stent. CONCLUSIONS: The most common failure mechanisms of covered stents are failure of delivery, stent dislodgement, and failure to seal the perforation.

33964252,Location of Superior Vena Cava Tears in Transvenous Lead Extraction.,"May, 2021","BACKGROUND: Superior vena cava (SVC) tears are rare but potentially lethal complications associated with transvenous lead extraction. When lacerations occur, surgeons need to be prepared for an emergent response. Nonetheless, little is known about the precise whereabouts of these lesions. Understanding the location and injury patterns enables a more anticipated and targeted surgical response. METHODS: We collected data via physician interviews after an SVC laceration occurred. These physicians were identified through the US Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database and independent physician reports of adverse events. We identified 116 reports of SVC tears between July 1, 2016, and July 31, 2018. For an SVC tear to be included in our registry, a cardiothoracic surgeon had to be physically present to confirm the injury via emergent sternotomy. In each case, the surgeon recorded the SVC injury's exact location after a repair was attempted. RESULTS: During the study period, 116 SVC tears were confirmed by sternotomy. Tears occurred in any combination of the following locations: SVC-innominate vein, body of the SVC, and SVC-right atrial junction. The majority of tears (n = 72; 62%) were located in the isolated body of the SVC, followed by the SVC-right atrial junction (n = 23;19.8%) and the SVC-innominate junction (n = 17;14.6%). Combined tears were rare, accounting for only 3.6% (n = 4) of the adverse events recorded. CONCLUSIONS: Most SVC tears occurred in the isolated body of the SVC.

33951709,Negative Pressure Wound Therapy Devices With Instillation/Irrigation: A Technologic Analysis.,"May, 2021","PURPOSE: The purpose of this technologic analysis was to critique technologic features of devices designed to deliver negative pressure wound therapy with instillation or irrigation (iNPWT). APPROACH: Published literature regarding negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) devices with the added feature of instillation or irrigation was reviewed to provide an overview of iNPWT. Varied features of devices currently available in the United States were described based on instructions published by individual manufacturers. Safety information regarding iNPWT was derived from the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) Database. CONCLUSIONS: The additional option of instillation or irrigation available with some NPWT devices may provide clinical benefits in carefully selected patients. Advantages may be related to facilitated removal of thick exudate and necrotic tissue.

33932271,The transseptal puncture experience: Safety insights from FDA MAUDE database.,"May, 2021","BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of literature on safety and efficacy of various transseptal puncture (TSP) needles. OBJECTIVES: To assess the reported mechanisms of failure, complications, and outcomes among the most frequently used transseptal needles in the United States. METHODS: We queried the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database between January 2011 and January 2021 for reports on the most commonly used transseptal needles: NRG (Baylis Medical, Montreal, Canada), and BRK (St. Jude, Saint Paul, MN)]. The primary outcome was the mechanism of failure. Secondary outcomes included clinical consequences of device failure. RESULTS: The final analysis included 306 reports of failure/complication with TSP needles (NRG n = 70, BRK n = 236). The most commonly reported mode of failure was detachment of the needle component (i.e., clip, hub, stopcock, shaft, spring, or needle tip) (14.7% overall; 17.8% BRK; and 4.3% NRG). Among these reports, cardiac perforation was the most common complication (69.9% overall; 69.1% for BRK; and 72.9% for NRG). Pericardiocentesis was the second most commonly reported complication (45.1% overall; 48.3% for BRK; and 34.3% for NRG). The procedure was successfully completed in 33.3% of all cases (36.4% for BRK and 22.9% for NRG), while surgical conversion was needed in (13.4% overall; 14% for BRK and 11.4% for NRG) of the reports. Death occurred in 3.9% of all cases overall (3.4% for BRK and 5.7% for NRG).

33766405,Is fluoride varnish safe?: Validating the safety of fluoride varnish.,"Mar, 2021","BACKGROUND: Fluoride varnish is widely used in dentistry as a caries preventive measure with recommendations for its use even in infants. In addition, nondental providers are also applying varnish on children's teeth in various settings. However, there are questions from these nondental providers as to the safety of fluoride varnish. METHODS: To evaluate and describe the adverse events (AEs) related to fluoride varnish, the US Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database was used. AEs reported for the dental product code for ""varnish, cavity,"" ""varnish,"" and ""fluoride"" were evaluated. The identified AEs were then reviewed and categorized using appropriate key words for the various signs and symptoms, outcomes, and treatment. RESULTS: Over the 10-year period, only 65 AEs were reported for fluoride varnish products. Swelling (33.8%); burning, itching, or soreness (23.1%); and rash (16.9%) were the most common signs and symptoms reported. The most common site reported was the lips (27.7%). The most common outcome was that the patient was taken to the hospital (18.5%) or emergency department (15.4%). No deaths were reported. The patients were treated primarily using diphenhydramine (Benadryl, Johnson & Johnson Consumer) (26.1%), followed by an epinephrine autoinjector (EpiPen, Mylan) and other forms of epinephrine (15.4%), and prednisolone (9.2%). In 16.9% of the cases with AEs there was a history of allergies. The rate of AEs is estimated to be between 0.099 and 0.105 per million for fluoride varnish. A concern is the likelihood of underreporting AEs in the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database. CONCLUSIONS: Given the widespread use of fluoride varnish in the United States, the number of AEs reported to the US Food and Drug Administration were few. Thus fluoride varnish can be considered a safe dental product.

33713856,Major adverse clinical events associated with implantation of a leadless intracardiac pacemaker.,"Mar, 2021","BACKGROUND: Leadless intracardiac pacemakers were developed to avoid the complications of transvenous pacing systems. The Medtronic Micra™ transcatheter pacemaker is one such system. We found an unexpected number of major adverse clinical events (MACE) in the Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturers and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database associated with Micra implantation. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe these MACE and compare them to implant procedure MACE in MAUDE for Medtronic CapSureFix™ active-fixation transvenous pacing leads. METHODS: During January 2021, we queried the MAUDE database for reports of MACE for Micra pacemakers and CapSureFix leads using the simple search terms ""death,"" ""tamponade,"" and ""perforation."" Reports from 2016-2020 were included. RESULTS: The search identified 363 MACE for Micra and 960 MACE for CapSureFix leads, including 96 Micra deaths (26.4%) vs 23 CapSureFix deaths (2.4%) (P <.001); 287 Micra tamponades (79.1%) vs 225 tamponades for CapSureFix (23.4%) (P <.001); and 99 rescue thoracotomies for Micra (27.3%) vs 50 rescue thoracotomies for CapSureFix (5.2%) (P <.001). More Micra patients required cardiopulmonary resuscitation (21.8% vs 1.1%) and suffered hypotension or shock (22.0% vs 5.8%) than CapSureFix recipients (P <.001). Micra patients were more likely to survive a myocardial perforation or tear if they had surgical repair (P = .014). CONCLUSION: Micra leadless pacemaker implantation may be complicated by myocardial and vascular perforations and tears that result in cardiac tamponade and death.

33662743,Deep brain stimulation and electromagnetic interference.,"Mar, 2021","Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has evolved into an approved and efficacious treatment for movement, obsessive-compulsive, and epilepsy disorders that are refractory to medical therapy, with current investigation into other disease conditions. However, there are unintentional and intentional sources of external electromagnetic interference (EMI) that can lead to either malfunctioning or damaged DBS devices, as well as injury to human tissue. Comprehensive studies and guidelines on such topics in the medical literature are scarce. Herein, we review the principles behind EMI, as well as the various potential sources of interference, both unintentional (e.g. stray EMI fields) and intentional (e.g. MRI scans, ""brainjacking""). Additionally, we employ the Manufacturer and User Device Facility Experience (MAUDE) database to assess real-world instances of EMI (e.g., airport body scanners, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and electrosurgery) affecting DBS devices commonly implanted in the United States (US).",No Full Text Available,deep brain stimulation and electromagnetic interference,deep brain stimulation dbs has evolved into an approved and efficacious treatment for movement obsessivecompulsive and epilepsy disorders that are refractory to medical therapy with current investigation into other disease conditions however there are unintentional and intentional sources of external electromagnetic interference emi that can lead to either malfunctioning or damaged dbs devices as well as injury to human tissue comprehensive studies and guidelines on such topics in the medical literature are scarce herein we review the principles behind emi as well as the various potential sources of interference both unintentional eg stray emi fields and intentional eg mri scans brainjacking additionally we employ the manufacturer and user device facility experience maude database to assess realworld instances of emi eg airport body scanners magnetic resonance imaging mri and electrosurgery affecting dbs devices commonly implanted in the united states us,deep brain stimulation electromagnetic interference deep brain stimulation db evolved approved efficacious treatment movement obsessivecompulsive epilepsy disorder refractory medical therapy current investigation disease condition however unintentional intentional source external electromagnetic interference emi lead either malfunctioning damaged db device well injury human tissue comprehensive study guideline topic medical literature scarce herein review principle behind emi well various potential source interference unintentional eg stray emi field intentional eg mri scan brainjacking additionally employ manufacturer user device facility experience maude database ass realworld instance emi eg airport body scanner magnetic resonance imaging mri electrosurgery affecting db device commonly implanted united state u,Uncertain
33625154,Barriers to Reporting: Limitations of the Maude Database.,"Feb, 2021","PURPOSE: Angio-Seal (Terumo Medical Corporations, Somerset, New Jersey) device is indicated for femoral arteriotomy closure. Real-world published data on complications are limited. We present 1 year of safety events involving Angio-Seal from the US Food and Drug Administration's post-market surveillance database of Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE). Steps for managing frequent device-related problems are discussed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Angio-Seal MAUDE data from November 2019 to December 2020 was classified according to (1) mode of device failure, (2) complication, (3) treatment, and (4) Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe (CIRSE) adverse event classification system. RESULTS: There were 715 safety events, involving Angio-Seal VIP (93.1%), Evolution (5.7%), STS Plus (1.1%), and sizes 6F (62.5%) and 8F (37.5%). Failure mode involved unrecognized use of a damaged device (43.4%), failed deployment (20.1%), failed arterial advancement (6.3%), detachment of device component (4.9%), failed retraction (3.6%), operator error (1.1%), and indeterminate (20.6%). Of total, 44.8% of events were associated with patient harm. Complications involved minor blood loss (34.1%), hematoma (5.6%), significant blood loss (1.4%), and pseudoaneurysm (1.4%). Of total, 43.3% of cases required manual compression (MC), whereas 8.8% required more advanced intervention. Interventions included surgical repair (49.2%), thrombin injection (9.5%), balloon tamponade (6.3%), covered stent (4.8%), and unspecified (30.2%). Majority of safety events were CIRSE grade 1 (92.0%), followed by grades 2 (3.1%), 3 (4.6%), and 6 (deaths, 0.3%). Minority of devices were returned for manufacturer analysis (27.8%). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of safety events were associated with minor blood loss or local hematoma and could be addressed with MC alone. Most events were attributed to damaged device; however, very few devices were returned to manufacturer for analysis. This should be encouraged to allow for root cause analysis in order to improve safety profile of devices. System-level strategies for addressing barriers to under-reporting of safety events may also be considered. CLINICAL IMPACT: Our study highlights important safety events encountered in real-world practice with Angio-Seal closure device. The MAUDE database captures real-world device malfunctions not typically appreciated in conventional clinical trials. Our study provides valuable insight for clinician-users on anticipating and managing the most common device malfunctions. Additionally, our data provide feedback for manufactures to optimize product design and direct manufacturer user training to improve safety.

There is a paucity of data on complications associated with its use in a real-life setting. METHODS: We queried the ""Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience"" MAUDE database between February 2019 and December 2020 for reports on MANTA device. RESULTS: We identified 250 reports in the MAUDE database from February 2019 through December 2020. The most common failure complication of MANTA is persistent bleeding (48.8%) and vessel occlusion or stenosis (29.6%). Most complications were managed successfully with an endovascular approach (48.4%), but a high number of patients required surgical intervention (40.4%). The most commonly reported failure mechanism was the failure of deployment (22%) followed by subcutaneous deployment (7.6%), intraluminal deployment (4.8%) amd detachment of collagen (2.8%). Access site infection was rare (1.2%). The 18 Fr. MANTA was associated with a lower risk of failure of deployment compared with the 14 Fr. device but was associated with a higher risk of vessel occlusion or stenosis (32.4% vs. 16.3%, p = 0.04) and thrombosis (11.6% vs 0%, p = 0.03).

33600931,A systematic review of the quality of cardiovascular surgery studies that extracted data from the MAUDE database.,"Feb, 2021","OBJECTIVE: To investigate opportunities and limitations of using the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database for cardiovascular surgery research, we analyzed the quality of studies having ever used MAUDE, in the field of cardiovascular surgery. METHODS: We systematically searched the Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, and Google Scholar for randomized and nonrandomized studies, from inception to July 2019. Two authors evaluated the quality of the retrieved observational studies, according to the National Institutes of Health quality assessment tool for either case series or cross-sectional studies. These tools quantify the quality of case series and cohorts/cross-sectional studies, respectively, with nine and 14 queries. RESULTS: Fifty-eight studies were included in the final qualitative review. Of 58 identified studies, 32 were case series, 8 were abstracts of case series, and 13 were reviews or case discussion with an included series from MAUDE. Also, five articles were cross-sectional studies. Of the 32 formal case series, 26 (81%) were found to have poor quality. The most common reasons for a poor quality designation included a lack of consecutive participants, undetermined comparability of participants, and undetermined follow-up adequacy. Only one out of five cross-sectional studies had fair quality; four others were evaluated as poor quality studies. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiovascular surgery studies using the MAUDE database, whether case series or cross-sectional design, are mostly of poor quality. Their low quality is partly caused by poor study design, but mainly by intrinsic limitations to the MAUDE database: cases recruited are not consecutive; patient characteristics are not detailed enough to allow a meaningful comparison of patient characteristics between different patient entries; outcome measures are unclear; there is a limited follow-up; and time-to-event data are lacking. We conclude that the quality of cardiovascular surgery publications that rely on data from MAUDE could be improved if investigators were to extract all relevant data points from MAUDE entries, then apply standard quality assessment tools in compiling and reporting the data. MAUDE might be improved if it used medical case report standards during the process of reporting and indexing adverse events. To calculate the incidence rate of any adverse event, all event-free cases, as well as all adverse events in patients using a device, are required.

33600834,Endovascular Stapler Complications During Minimally Invasive Nephrectomy: An Updated Review of the FDA MAUDE Database From 2009-2019.,"Feb, 2021","OBJECTIVE: To characterize the rates of endovascular stapler complications during hilar ligation in minimally invasive radical nephrectomy over the last 10 years. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We reviewed the Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database from January 1, 2009 to August 1, 2019. Staplers were categorized according to type, namely Ethicon Inc. endocutters (Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick NJ); Endo-GIA (Medtronic, Minneapolis MN); and Endo-TA (Medtronic, Minneapolis MN). RESULTS: There were 383 cases of complications involving staplers, 63% with Ethicon endocutters; 28% with GIA; and 9% with TA. 22 deaths (5.7% of total complications) were attributed to staplers. No deaths or reoperations occurred due to TA staplers. TA staplers were also associated with a reduced incidence of conversion to open as compared to Ethicon and GIA staplers. Apart from one device, manufacturer evaluation of returned devices either showed no abnormalities or attributed fault to improper use of staplers. DISCUSSION: We characterized stapler complications during a 10-year period for minimally invasive radical nephrectomy. No deaths or reoperations occurred due to TA staplers, perhaps due to cutting and stapling occurring in separate steps.

33539651,Real-world experience of suture-based closure devices: Insights from the FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience.,"Feb, 2021","OBJECTIVES: We analyzed post-marketing surveillance data from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database for suture-based vascular closure devices (VCDs) - Perclose ProGlide (Abbott, Chicago, Illinois) and Prostar XL (Abbott). BACKGROUND: Suture-based VCDs are mostly used for large-bore femoral arterial access-site closure. Real-world, contemporary experience on the most commonly reported complications and modes of failure associated with these devices is limited. METHODS: Post-marketing surveillance data from the FDA MAUDE database, for the ProGlide system and for the Prostar XL system, were analyzed, yielding 827 Perclose ProGlide reports and 175 Prostar XL reports. RESULTS: Of the 827 reports of major complications involving the Perclose ProGlide devices, 404 reports involved injury, and one involved death related to the device. In the Prostar XL analysis, 94 reports involved injury, and one involved death. Bleeding from vessel injury was the most common adverse outcome described with both devices, followed by hematoma and thrombus. Surgical repair was the most commonly used treatment strategy. In terms of device malfunction, suture-related malfunction (212 reports) was most commonly seen in the Perclose ProGlide group, while failed deployment was most commonly seen in the Prostar XL group. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis of the MAUDE database demonstrates that in real-world practice, suture-based VCDs were found to be associated with complications, including vascular injury, difficulties with the device itself, and even death.

Currently, most available safety information on TORS procedures describes adverse events occurring in the context of clinical trials or series at high-volume academic centers. The goal of this study was to catalog reported adverse events associated with the da Vinci device in head and neck procedures by querying an FDA database. A search was performed on the MAUDE database inspecting for TORS safety incident reports generated from January 2009 through May 2020 using key words ""da Vinci"" and ""Intuitive Surgical"". A total of 3312 medical device records were produced. Of these 36 head and neck adverse events, reports were identified through manual screening of the data by the authors. Death was found to be the most common adverse event reported overall, manifesting in 44% of all reported incidents.

33380842,"Characterization of Device-Related Malfunction, Injury, and Death Associated with Using Elastomeric Pumps for Delivery of Local Anesthetics in the US Food and Drug Administration MAUDE Database.","Jan, 2021","PURPOSE: To characterize medical device reports about elastomeric pumps delivering local anesthesia made to the US Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of medical device reports submitted to MAUDE from January 2010 to July 2018. A systematic, computerized algorithm was used to identify records pertaining to elastomeric pumps using local anesthesia. Included records indicated the use of local anesthesia or were determined to involve the use of local anesthetics (if they did not contain specific information on drug use). Reports were analyzed within the MAUDE event type categories of malfunction, injury, death, other, and missing. Possible cases of liver injury or surgical site infection were also identified. Manual review of narratives provided in MAUDE was performed by 2 reviewers to identify possible or probable cases of local anesthetic system toxicity (LAST). RESULTS: From a pool of 384,285 reports about elastomeric pumps from the MAUDE database, 4093 met inclusion criteria for involving elastomeric pumps to deliver local anesthetics, with the peak number of reports occurring in 2014. Of these identified reports, 3624 (88.5%) were categorized as malfunctions, 292 (7.1%) as injuries, and 8 (0.2%) as involving death. We identified 13 cases (0.3%) of possible liver injury and 51 cases (1.2%) of possible surgical site infection; 139 reports (3.4%) were determined to be probably (n=53) or possibly (n=86) associated with LAST. CONCLUSION: Malfunction of elastomeric pumps delivering local anesthetics leaves patients vulnerable to injury or death.

33071196,Adverse Events and Modes of Failure Related to Rotational Atherectomy System: The Utility of the MAUDE Database.,"Oct, 2020","BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Coronary artery calcification is a marker of advanced atherosclerosis and a predictor of adverse clinical outcomes. Rotational atherectomy (RA) can effectively modify calcified lesions, optimizing procedural outcomes. We interrogated the most commonly reported adverse events involving rotational atherectomy systems (Rotablator and Rotapro) by analyzing post-marketing surveillance data from the Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. METHODS/MATERIALS: We queried MAUDE from September 1, 2016, through December 31, 2019. After excluding duplicate reports, we included 363 reports for Rotablator and 63 reports for Rotapro in the final analysis. RESULTS: Percentages represent the proportion of total submitted MAUDE reports. The most commonly reported complications for Rotablator and Rotapro included dissection (2.7% and 6.3%, respectively) and perforation (4.1% and 19%, respectively). The most commonly reported device-related issues included detachment or structural damage, or both, for Rotablator (39.1%) and entrapment of the device component for Rotapro (47.6%). The most commonly damaged device component was the Rotawire, whereas the most commonly entrapped device component was the Rotaburr for both device configurations. Rotablator and Rotapro device-related complications were most commonly reported for the left anterior descending artery. CONCLUSION: An analysis of the MAUDE database demonstrates that in real-world practice, RA devices are associated with important complications.

33003133,Vaginal energy-based devices: characterization of adverse events based on the last decade of MAUDE safety reports.,"Oct, 2020","OBJECTIVES: Energy-based devices have gained momentum as minimally invasive procedures to treat both medical and cosmetic pelvic floor disorders including genitourinary syndrome of menopause, vaginal laxity, stress urinary incontinence, dyspareunia, and vulvar disorders such as lichen diseases and vestibulitis. However, the FDA recently issued a statement cautioning patients and providers that the safety and efficacy of energy-based devices for the treatment of vaginal symptoms has not been well established. Additionally, the FDA sent letters to the manufactures of energy-based devices with notifications that they could be violating the marketing standards of the FDA. The existing data on side effects is insufficient and limited to observational studies. We sought to characterize the safety events of vaginal energy-based devices by analysis of surveillance data from the FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database and specifically look at those events that occurred prior to the July 30, 2018 warning. METHODS: The MAUDE database was queried between September 30, 2013 and October 31, 2019 for all vaginal energy-based devices. The incidence of safety events was reported for these devices and the most common complaints were described and characterized. Event reporting was analyzed before and after July 30, 2018. RESULTS: Forty-two unique and relevant medical device reports (MDRs) were retrieved. The Mona Lisa Touch had the highest number of MDRs (40.5%) followed by ThermiVa (16.7%) and Viveve (14.2%). Each medical device report was associated with a single patient experience and within the 42 medical device reports, there were 85 complaints. A majority of the MDR complaints (52.9%) were also indications for energy-based devices procedures, which include vaginal pain, dyspareunia, lichen sclerosis, and urinary frequency. Two-thirds of the complaints (68.2%) were related to pain, but serious adverse events such as third-degree burns (3.5%) were rare. Most of the reportable events occurred before July 30, 2018 (83.3%), but most were reported after July 30, 2018 (78.6%). CONCLUSIONS: MAUDE-reported data suggests that the majority of patient complaints after vaginal energy-based device treatment include vaginal pain, bladder pain, and urinary symptoms. This study suggests that the majority of complaints are not severe, and some may be related to progression of the disease. The few severe adverse events reported in the MAUDE database may have contributed to the FDA warning regarding energy-based devices.

However, IDs may contribute to free flap complications or failure and better understanding of device malfunctions is needed. METHODS:  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database was queried for all reports of ID adverse events from two leading manufacturers (Cook Vascular and Synovis Life Technologies) in free flap surgery from January 2010 to March 2020. Reports were reviewed and categorized. A comparison of reoperations within select categories was performed using Chi-square analysis. RESULTS:  Of 209 included reports, the most common device malfunctions were venous anastomotic coupler misalignment (35.4%) and coupler ring detachment (24.4%). Synovis devices were used in 100% of reports of vessel compression and Cook Vascular devices were used in 77.7% of reports of probe detachment. Of 74 patient-related adverse events, the most common were reoperation (47.3%) and vessel occlusion (28.4%). Of five reported events of flap failure, two were associated with loss of ID signal. The proportion of Doppler signal loss events leading to reoperation was significantly greater than the proportion of any other Doppler-related event leading to reoperation. Intraoperative coupler replacement was the most commonly reported intervention ( CONCLUSION:  This study demonstrates a variety of ID-related malfunctions.

A low rate of complications was noted in these studies. The broader complication profile for CDR in widespread clinical practice has yet to be described. PURPOSE: To outline the complications reported to the FDA regarding commonly used CDR products STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Retrospective database review PATIENT SAMPLE: Nationwide database of reported complications related to CDR products from patients across the country OUTCOME MEASURES: Complications related to CDR METHODS: We queried the MAUDE database and Alternative Summary Reporting (ASR) data files submitted between January 2005 to March 2020. The complications listed for seven FDA-approved CDR implants were analyzed. The entries in the databases were cataloged for complication type, date of entry, source of report, and whether the investigation was ""complete"". Reports that had too little information to extract relevant data were excluded. RESULTS: There were 1,517 entries identified in the MAUDE database. After removal of duplicate entries and entries without sufficient information, there were 1,347 entries analyzed. The top five complications were (1) migration of implant (338 entries, 25.2%) (2) insertion problem/failure (312 entries, 23.3%) (3) neck pain (203 entries, 15.2%) (4) heterotopic ossification (108 entries, 8.1%) and (5) radiculopathy (90 entries, 8.1%). The number of analyzed implant-related MAUDE entries and most common implant-related complication for each implant was 209 entries for insertion problem/failure for Mobi-C; 158 entries for migration of implant for ProDisc-C; 154 entries for insertion problem/failure for Bryan cervical disc; 130 entries for migration of implant for Prestige cervical disc; 49 entries for migration of implant for PCM cervical disc; 12 entries for migration of implant for M6 and 10 entries for migration of implant for Secure-C. Only 263 entries (19.5%) were deemed ""complete"". Most entries were from the manufacturer/company representative/distributor (923 entries, 70%).

32804270,Electromagnetic interference on cardiac pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators during endoscopy as reported to the US Federal Drug Administration.,"Aug, 2020","INTRODUCTION: More than 3 million patients have a cardiac implanted electronic device (CIED) such as a pacemaker or implanted cardioverter-defibrillator in the USA. These devices are susceptible to electromagnetic interference (EMI) leading to malfunction and injury. Radiofrequency energy, the most common modality for obtaining hemostasis during endoscopy, is the most common source of EMI. Few studies have evaluated the effect of endoscopic radiofrequency energy on CIEDs. We aim to characterize CIED dysfunction related to endoscopic procedures. We hypothesize that EMI from endoscopic energy can result in patient injury. METHODS: We queried the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database for CIED dysfunction related to electrosurgical devices over a 10-year period (2009-2019). CIED dysfunction events were identified using seven problem codes (malfunction, electromagnetic interference, ambient noise, pacing problem, over-sensing, inappropriate shock, defibrillation). These were cross-referenced for the terms ""cautery, electrocautery, endoscopy, esophagus, colonoscopy, colon, esophagoscopy, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy."" Reports were individually reviewed to confirm and characterize CIED malfunction due to an endoscopic procedure. RESULTS: A search for CIED dysfunction resulted in 43,759 reports. Three hundred and eleven reports (0.7%) were associated with electrocautery, and of these, 45 reports (14.5%) included endoscopy. Ten reports involving endoscopy (22%) specified upper (3, 7%) or lower (7, 16%) endoscopy while the remainder were non-specific. Twenty-six of reports involving endoscopy (58%) suffered injury because of CIED dysfunction: Of these, 17 (65%) received inappropriate shocks, 5 (19%) had pacing inhibition with bradycardia or asystole, 3 (12%) had CIED damage requiring explant and replacement, and 1 (4%) patient suffered ventricular tachycardia requiring hospital admission. CONCLUSION: The use of energy during endoscopy can cause dysfunction of CIEDs. This most commonly results in inappropriate defibrillation, symptomatic bradycardia, and asystole. Patients with CIEDs undergoing endoscopy should undergo pre- and post-procedure device interrogation and re-programming to avoid patient injury.",No Full Text Available,electromagnetic interference on cardiac pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators during endoscopy as reported to the us federal drug administration,introduction more than  million patients have a cardiac implanted electronic device cied such as a pacemaker or implanted cardioverterdefibrillator in the usa these devices are susceptible to electromagnetic interference emi leading to malfunction and injury radiofrequency energy the most common modality for obtaining hemostasis during endoscopy is the most common source of emi few studies have evaluated the effect of endoscopic radiofrequency energy on cieds we aim to characterize cied dysfunction related to endoscopic procedures we hypothesize that emi from endoscopic energy can result in patient injury methods we queried the manufacturer and user facility device experience maude database for cied dysfunction related to electrosurgical devices over a year period  cied dysfunction events were identified using seven problem codes malfunction electromagnetic interference ambient noise pacing problem oversensing inappropriate shock defibrillation these were crossreferenced for the terms cautery electrocautery endoscopy esophagus colonoscopy colon esophagoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy reports were individually reviewed to confirm and characterize cied malfunction due to an endoscopic procedure results a search for cied dysfunction resulted in  reports three hundred and eleven reports  were associated with electrocautery and of these  reports  included endoscopy ten reports involving endoscopy  specified upper   or lower   endoscopy while the remainder were nonspecific twentysix of reports involving endoscopy  suffered injury because of cied dysfunction of these   received inappropriate shocks   had pacing inhibition with bradycardia or asystole   had cied damage requiring explant and replacement and   patient suffered ventricular tachycardia requiring hospital admission conclusion the use of energy during endoscopy can cause dysfunction of cieds this most commonly results in inappropriate defibrillation symptomatic bradycardia and asystole patients with cieds undergoing endoscopy should undergo pre and postprocedure device interrogation and reprogramming to avoid patient injury,electromagnetic interference cardiac pacemaker implantable cardioverter defibrillator endoscopy reported u federal drug administration introduction million patient cardiac implanted electronic device cied pacemaker implanted cardioverterdefibrillator usa device susceptible electromagnetic interference emi leading malfunction injury radiofrequency energy common modality obtaining hemostasis endoscopy common source emi study evaluated effect endoscopic radiofrequency energy cieds aim characterize cied dysfunction related endoscopic procedure hypothesize emi endoscopic energy result patient injury method queried manufacturer user facility device experience maude database cied dysfunction related electrosurgical device year period cied dysfunction event identified using seven problem code malfunction electromagnetic interference ambient noise pacing problem oversensing inappropriate shock defibrillation crossreferenced term cautery electrocautery endoscopy esophagus colonoscopy colon esophagoscopy esophagogastroduodenoscopy report individually reviewed confirm characterize cied malfunction due endoscopic procedure result search cied dysfunction resulted report three hundred eleven report associated electrocautery report included endoscopy ten report involving endoscopy specified upper lower endoscopy remainder nonspecific twentysix report involving endoscopy suffered injury cied dysfunction received inappropriate shock pacing inhibition bradycardia asystole cied damage requiring explant replacement patient suffered ventricular tachycardia requiring hospital admission conclusion use energy endoscopy cause dysfunction cieds commonly result inappropriate defibrillation symptomatic bradycardia asystole patient cieds undergoing endoscopy undergo pre postprocedure device interrogation reprogramming avoid patient injury,Uncertain

32569070,Comparison of Early Fatigue Failure of the TFNa and Gamma 3 Cephalomedullary Nails in the United States From 2015 to 2019.,"Jun, 2020","OBJECTIVES: To compare reports of implant fatigue failure submitted to the FDA of 2 commonly used cephalomedullary nails. METHODS: In total, 2724 medical device reports from the FDA's MAUDE database from Jan 2015 to Oct 2019 were reviewed for the Trochanteric Femoral Nail-Advanced (TFNa) and Gamma 3 implants. RESULTS: Data from 342 implant failures included in the MAUDE database were analyzed. TFNa and Gamma 3 had 183 and 159 reported fatigue failures, respectively. All failed implants fractured in the same location through the proximal screw aperture. Time from implantation to failure was on average 2 months shorter for TFNa implants that were reported fractured than for Gamma 3 implants reported, a difference that was statistically significant (P < 0.05). In total, 100 implants were reported to have failed within the first 4 months (53 and 47 for TFNa and Gamma 3, respectively). For Gamma 3 implants that failed in the first 4 months, almost all of the available manufacturers' inspection reports revealed implant notches at the point of failure from drilling. For TFNa implants that failed early, only one reported notch was noted in the available inspection reports. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to other studies regarding fatigue failure, reported failures in both TFNa and Gamma 3 occurred earlier than can be attributed to delayed or nonunion. The reported failures of the TFNa in the MAUDE database occurred earlier than did those of the Gamma 3. Early failures of the Gamma 3 seemed to be the result of iatrogenic implant notching.

This study sought to quantify nasopharyngoscope microbial contamination relative to that of other endoscope categories and characterize the manufacturers, outcomes, and microbial profiles associated with these cases. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective, cross-sectional study. METHODS: A total of 3,865 adverse events were collected from 2013 to 2019 using the US Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database. The fraction of total device failures associated with contamination was quantified for nasopharyngoscopes, bronchoscopes, duodenoscopes, and gastroscopes. Odds ratios of nasopharyngoscope contamination compared to that of bronchoscopes, duodenoscopes, or gastroscopes were calculated, and significance was assessed by χ RESULTS: Nasopharyngoscope device failures were reported at an incidence of 0.646 per month; 34.1% involved contamination, comparable to the frequency observed for bronchoscopes (23.4%, P = .118), duodenoscopes (29.2%, P = .493), and gastroscopes (45.3%, P = .178). The frequency of device contamination was observed to be significantly higher for a particular endoscope manufacturer regardless of endoscope category (Kruskal-Wallis P = .021). In instances of contamination, nasopharyngoscopes were significantly less associated with patient harm or death than bronchoscope (odds ratio [OR] = 10.2) and duodenoscope (OR = 4.81) cases. CONCLUSIONS: Although the rates of contamination were comparable across all endoscope categories, nasopharyngoscope contamination was less commonly associated with patient harm or death. In an era of rising healthcare costs, determining adequate disinfection standards for nasopharyngoscopes and their impact on patient safety is crucial.

32537301,Death by Implants: Critical Analysis of the FDA-MAUDE Database on Breast Implant-related Mortality.,"Jun, 2020","UNLABELLED: Since the 1992 moratorium by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the debate on the association of breast implants with systemic illnesses has been ongoing. Breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma has also raised significant safety concerns in recent years. METHODS: A systematic search of the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was performed to identify all cases of breast implant-associated deaths reported to the FDA. RESULTS: The search identified 50 reported cases of apparent implant-related mortality; breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma comprised the majority of fatal outcomes (n = 21, 42%), followed by lymphoma (n = 4, 8%), breast cancer (n = 3, 6%), pancreatic cancer (n = 2, 4%), implant rupture (n = 2, 4%), and postoperative infections (n = 2, 4%). Single cases (n = 1, 2% each) of leukemia, small bowel cancer, lung disease, pneumonia, autoimmune and joint disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, liver failure, and sudden death, and 2 cases (4%) of newborn deaths, to mothers with breast implants, were also identified. A literature review demonstrated that 54% of alleged implant-related deaths were not truly associated with breast implant use: the majority of these reports (82%) originated from the public and third-party sources, rather than evidence-based reports by health-care professionals and journal articles. CONCLUSIONS: Although there exists a need for more comprehensive reporting in federal databases, the information available should be considered for a more complete understanding of implant-associated adverse outcomes.

32505511,Adverse events involving hallux metatarsophalangeal joint implants: Analysis of the United States Food and Drug Administration data from 2010 to 2018.,"Jun, 2020","BACKGROUND: The prevalence of osteoarthritis of the hallux metatarsophalangeal joint (MTPJ) is 1 in 40 people over the age of 50. Surgical treatment options for MTPJ arthritis include joint preservation, joint resurfacing, and arthrodesis. Hallux MTPJ implants have evolved over the past several decades, but are associated with various complications. The aim of this study was to examine the MAUDE database to determine reported adverse events for hallux MTPJ implants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was reviewed from 2010 to 2018 to review voluntary reported adverse event reports for approved implants within the United States. We recorded the type of adverse event and excluded duplicate reports and those extracted from already published literature. RESULTS: Among 64 reported hallux MTPJ implant adverse events, the most common modes of adverse events were component loosening (34%), infection (14.1%), component fracture (9.4%), inflammation (9.4%), and allergic reaction (7.8%). Regarding implant type, Cartiva SCI had the highest percentage of adverse events (23.4%), followed by Arthrosurface ToeMotion (20.3%), Ascension MGT (12.5%), Arthrosurface HemiCAP® (10.9%), Futura primus (9.4%), and Osteomed Reflexion (6.3%). There was an increase in reported adverse events after 2016. The MAUDE database does not report the total incidence of implant insertion. CONCLUSION: Our study of the MAUDE database demonstrated that component loosening and infection are the most common modes of adverse events for hallux MTPJ implants. Cartiva accounted for one-fourth of the implant-related adverse events during our study period, followed by ToeMotion, and Ascension MGT implants.

32405561,Device-Related Complications Associated with Magec Rod Usage for Distraction-Based Correction of Scoliosis.,"May, 2020","INTRODUCTION: Recent literature identifies similar failure rates such as anchor pull-out and rod breakage, but a higher unplanned revision surgery with MAGEC rods than with traditional growth rods. Besides known failure modes such as rod fracture, infection, etc., failure to noninvasively distract the rods was cited as the main cause of such unplanned surgeries. The source of these data ranges from multicenter cohort studies to singular case series. These studies included explanted implants that had undergone failure in distraction mechanism, rod fracture, or infection, or had reached their maximum length. Nevertheless, in addition to identifying the overall mode of failure, it is equally important to identify the large-scale incidence of exclusive failures in comparison with standard instrumentation failure modes in spine surgery. METHODS: The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) databases were searched for reports on MAGEC rods, and on standard instrumentation used for spinal fusion. The adverse events were recorded, tabulated, and analyzed. RESULTS: A search of the US FDA MAUDE database yielded reports of 163 device-related adverse events. These included distraction mechanism failure (n=129), rod fracture (n=24), and minor voluntary reports of infection and tissue discoloration (n=10). For standard instrumentation usage in spine surgery, pedicle screw breakage post surgery (n=336), set screw damage during surgery (n=257), rod breakage post surgery (n=175), interbody cage breakage during surgery (n=118), and pedicle screw breakage during surgery (n=75) were identified as the top 5 failure modes.

32339729,Classifying Device-Related Complications Associated With Intrathecal Baclofen Pumps: A MAUDE Study.,"Apr, 2020","BACKGROUND: Intrathecal baclofen (ITB) is an effective treatment for spasticity, and therapeutic levels may be optimized using surgically implanted pumps. Though these devices are effective, complications can pose significant challenges to patients, decreasing the therapeutic effect and potentially requiring reoperation. As such, it is critical that complications associated with ITB be effectively characterized. METHODS: We queried the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database for cases reported during the past 3 years documenting adverse events specifically related to ITB pumps. We identified 1935 adverse events that were individually analyzed and categorized by type of complication. RESULTS: Out of the 1935 unique adverse events identified from the MAUDE database, 25.7% were device-related complications (n = 497). Of those, 50.3% were catheter-specific (n = 250), 21.3% (n = 106) were pump-specific, and 28.3% (n = 141) were included, more generally, in catheter or device erosion.

32282600,Temporal Trends of Urogynecologic Mesh Reports to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.,"Apr, 2020","OBJECTIVE: To compare temporal trends of urogynecologic mesh medical device reports with sentinel U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) notices and to examine all linked reports of patient death. METHODS: The Reed Tech Navigator is an online tool used to extract and analyze data in the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database. We used FDA product codes to search for reports of synthetic mesh for stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and pelvic organ prolapse (POP). Reports with ""death"" listed as a patient event were queried further. RESULTS: There were 43,970 medical device reports involving urogynecologic mesh reported to the FDA between August 2000 and January 2019, with most occurring after the 2011 FDA communication (n=43,018, 97.8%). Of these medical device reports, 64.6% (n=28,422) were for SUI products, 27.0% (n=11,876) were for transvaginal POP products, and 8.4% (n=3,672) were for transabdominal POP products. Peak reporting occurred in 2013, which corresponded with the first major plaintiff verdicts and class action vaginal mesh settlement. There were 645 (1.5%) medical device reports of death, with 49.3% (n=318) having no cause of death identified. Only four (0.6%) could be directly attributed to the initial surgery. CONCLUSION: Since 2011, urogynecologic mesh has been the focus of thousands of medical device reports annually, although the data submitted are often incomplete.

32269176,The First 4 Years of Postmarketing Safety Surveillance Related to the MitraClip Device: A United States Food and Drug Administration MAUDE Experience.,"Apr, 2020","OBJECTIVE: The MitraClip (Abbott) is a commercially available device to perform percutaneous transcatheter mitral valve repair (TMVR) for patients with symptomatic mitral regurgitation (MR). Recent data support its role in appropriately selected patients with functional MR, and its use is poised to increase. However, limited safety data in ""real-world"" practice are available after market introduction. METHODS: We queried all available adverse event reports from the publicly available Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database including ""injuries"" and ""deaths"" from October 2013 (date of Food and Drug Administration [FDA] premarket approval) to September 2017 using the following search limits: brand name (""MitraClip"") and product code (""NKM,"" a unique FDA designation linked to MitraClip). RESULTS: During the first 4 years after FDA approval, MAUDE received 200 death reports and 1666 injury reports containing 2974 unique adverse events. Of all death reports, 21% described deaths occurring >1 year post MitraClip and 30% included limited details. The top three known causes of death included complications requiring rescue high-risk surgery, clip detachment or unsuccessful clip placement, and damage to the valvular apparatus. Similar non-fatal events were reported. Additional procedures or surgical intervention were required in 227 injury events (8%). CONCLUSIONS: While injuries reported to the FDA have steadily increased with more widespread use of TMVR, device- or procedure-related death reports have accrued more slowly, corroborating a potential institutional or operator learning curve with this device.

METHODS: A systematic MAUDE database review was performed. Annual reports were searched using keywords: (a) ""power wheelchair"" and ""injury"" and (b) ""mechanical (also known as manual) wheelchair"" and ""injury."" Reports related to injuries from ILED on the footplate were reviewed. RESULTS: Reports of 1075 wheelchair injuries were found across the review period. Twenty nine (3%) met our inclusion criteria. The most common source of reports was ""manufacturer."" The wheelchair was unavailable for evaluation in 55.17% of reports. Manufacturers' submission dates (number of days that passed after they were notified) ranged from 3 to 159. Reported injuries decreased by 60% from 2014 to 2018. The end user used a power wheelchair for all but one report. The most common injuries were single fractures, multiple fractures, wounds/cuts/infections, and amputations (in order of incidence). The most common mechanism was the foot slipping off the footplate during wheelchair mobility. CONCLUSIONS: We observed inherent weaknesses in the MAUDE database reporting process and a concerning level of reporting bias.

32128936,Medical device active surveillance of spontaneous reports: A literature review of signal detection methods.,"Mar, 2020","PURPOSE: The collection and analysis of real-world data for the active monitoring of medical device performance and safety has become increasingly important. Spontaneous reports, such as those in the Food & Drug Administration's (FDA's) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE), provide early warning of potential issues with marketed devices. This review synthesizes the current literature on medical device surveillance signal detection and provides a framework for application of methods to active surveillance of spontaneous reports. METHODS: Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Scopus, and PubMed databases were systematically searched up to January 2019. Additionally, five methods articles from pharmacovigilance were added that had potential applications to medical devices. RESULTS: Among 105 articles included, the most common source of data (84%) was registries; median time between data collection and publication was 8 years. Surgical procedure outcome signal detection articles comprised 83% while 14% were on device outcome signal detection. The most common family of methods cited (70%) was Sequential Probability Ratio. CONCLUSION: Application of any signal detection algorithm requires careful consideration of influential factors, data limitations, and algorithmic assumptions. We recommend approaches using disproportionality, statistical process control, and sequential probability tests and provide R packages to further development efforts. The small number of published examples suggest that further development of statistical methods and technological solutions to analyze large amounts of data for device safety and performance is needed.

31982244,Early Polyethylene Failure in a Modern Total Hip Prosthesis: A Note of Caution.,"Jan, 2020","BACKGROUND: Historically, there has been excellent survivorship of total hip arthroplasty with newer implants expected to outperform prior generations. Review of our institutional database identified problems with one particular cross-linked polyethylene liner in mid-term follow-up, which has not been reported in the literature. We report on the technical aspects of this liner, as well as the clinical and radiographic factors associated with early failure of this bearing in our practice. METHODS: A retrospective review of our institutional database was performed from January 2009 to June 2019 of patients who presented with significant osteolysis in the setting of prior total hip arthroplasty with a contemporary polyethylene liner. Demographic and radiographic measures were collected for all patients. RESULTS: Twelve patients were identified, with nine undergoing revision surgery. All patients demonstrated radiographic osteolysis at the time of revision surgery. The average time to diagnosis of failure was 55.9 months (range: 12-120 months). Average cup position preoperatively was 44 degrees inclination (range: 36-53 degrees) and 21 degrees anteversion (range: 10-34 degrees). Nine patients underwent revision of the acetabular component, with two also undergoing femoral component revision. The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database revealed 22 reported cases of wear-related failure from 2009 to 2019.

31991097,A 20-Year Analysis of Adverse Events and Litigation With Light-Based Skin Resurfacing Procedures.,"Jan, 2020","PURPOSE: The popularity and availability of facial rejuvenation procedures have increased exponentially during the previous decade. The present study aimed to provide an overview of photorejuvenation and evaluate the complications and litigation related to light-based skin resurfacing procedures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was performed using the US Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) registry and the Thomson Reuter Westlaw Edge database from May 1, 1999 to May 1, 2019. The MAUDE registry was queried using the manufacturer brands. Adverse events were individually reviewed, and data were gathered regarding the company, complication, body location, and device type. The litigation cases were individually reviewed, and information was gathered on plaintiff gender, defendant specialty, allegation, jury verdict, the appeals verdict, and the award amount, if applicable. RESULTS: A total of 697 adverse events were included in the final sample. The most commonly reported complications were burns (61.1%), followed by scarring (16.2%), hyperpigmentation (7.8%), and hypopigmentation (7.0%). More rare, noncosmetic complications included infection (3.9%) and nerve (1.4%) and ocular (1.3%) damage. The rates of scarring with facial treatments were greater (24.3 vs 10.3%; P < .01) and the rates of burns with ablative lasers were lower (25.9 vs 66.0%; P < .01). With respect to litigation, of the 9 cases identified, all the plaintiffs were women. The most common allegation was procedural negligence (88.8%), followed by cosmetic deformity (77.7%) and the lack of informed consent (55.5%). The jury ruled in favor of the plaintiff in 4 cases (44.4%), and the mean award was $656,000. CONCLUSIONS: The most common adverse events were burns, scars, and pigmentation changes.

31842798,Unrecognized maternal heart rate artefact in cases of perinatal mortality reported to the United States Food and Drug Administration from 2009 to 2019: a critical patient safety issue.,"Dec, 2019","BACKGROUND: Maternal heart rate artefact is a signal processing error whereby the fetal heart rate is masked by the maternal pulse, potentially leading to danger by failure to recognize an abnormal fetal heart rate or a pre-existing fetal death. Maternal heart rate artefact may be exacerbated by autocorrelation algorithms in modern fetal monitors due to smooth transitions between maternal and fetal heart rates rather than breaks in the tracing. In response, manufacturers of cardiotocography monitors recommend verifying fetal life prior to monitoring and have developed safeguards including signal ambiguity detection technologies to simultaneously and continuously monitor the maternal and fetal heart rates. However, these safeguards are not emphasized in current cardiotocography clinical practice guidelines, potentially leading to a patient safety gap. METHODS: The United States Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database was reviewed for records with event type ""Death"" for the time period March 31, 2009 to March 31, 2019, in combination with search terms selected to capture all cases reported involving cardiotocography devices. Records were reviewed to determine whether maternal heart rate artefact was probable and/or whether the report contained a recommendation from the device manufacturer regarding maternal heart rate artefact. RESULTS: Forty-seven cases of perinatal mortality were identified with probable maternal heart rate artefact including 14 with antepartum fetal death prior to initiation of cardiotocography, 14 with intrapartum fetal death or neonatal death after initiation of cardiotocography, and 19 where the temporal relationship between initiation of cardiotocography and death cannot be definitively established from the report. In 29 cases, there was a recommendation from the manufacturer regarding diagnosis and/or management of maternal heart rate artefact. CONCLUSIONS: This case series indicates a recurring problem with undetected maternal heart rate artefact leading to perinatal mortality and, in cases of pre-existing fetal death, healthcare provider confusion. In response, manufacturers frequently recommend safeguards which are found in their device's instructions for use but not in major intrapartum cardiotocography guidelines.

31860011,Outcomes Before and After the Recall of a Heart Failure Pacemaker.,"Dec, 2019","IMPORTANCE: Timely and complete disclosure of medical device defects is necessary to manage patient care safely and effectively. OBJECTIVES: To determine if the manufacturer's recommendations following the recall of a medical device were timely and complete, the follow-up information and data provided to patients and physicians were adequate for managing patient care, and the actions taken by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding the recall were appropriate. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This single-center retrospective case series included 90 of 448 patients who were implanted with a cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemaker at the Minneapolis Heart Institute from May 2003 through January 2011; this pacemaker was recalled in November 2015. In addition, returned product reports submitted by the manufacturer to the FDA via the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database from January 2008 through December 2018 were analyzed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Clinical outcomes were serious adverse clinical events that occurred before and after the November 2015 recall notifying physicians and patients that the device's battery could fail unexpectedly because of high internal impedance. Technical outcomes were signs and causes of failure. RESULTS: Five of 90 patients observed during 2015 experienced syncope when their pacemakers stopped pacing owing to battery or wire connection defects prior to the recall. Of the 90 patients, 37 (41%) were men, and the median (interquartile range) age at implantation was 71.3 (66.1-78.2) years. Analysis of the MAUDE data revealed that battery failures prior to the recall were associated with serious adverse events that included 1 death, 1 cardiac arrest, 5 syncopal attacks, and 6 heart failure exacerbations; 3 additional prerecall syncopal events were caused by wire connection defects. The manufacturer and the FDA were aware of the battery and wire connection defects for 19 months before issuing the recall, yet the wire connection problem was not included in the advisory and physicians were not informed that interrogating the pacemaker could result in loss of pacing. The FDA classified the recall as class II rather than the more critical class I. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This case series study of patients implanted with a defective pacemaker found that the pacemaker recall was delayed and that subsequent communications did not include all critical information needed for safe and effective patient care.

31853803,High shocking and pacing impedances due to defibrillation lead calcification.,"Dec, 2019","PURPOSE: We have reported the calcification of Endotak defibrillation leads that required replacement. The aim of this study was to assess calcified Endotak Reliance leads in the Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database and compare them to calcified Sprint Fidelis, Sprint Quattro Secure, Riata, and Durata leads in MAUDE. METHODS: We searched the MAUDE database from 2008 to 2019 for defibrillation lead calcification using the terms ""calcium,"" ""calcification,"" and ""calcified"". Included were explanted leads whose manufacturers found calcium on the shocking and/or pacing electrode. RESULTS: The MAUDE search identified 113 calcified defibrillation leads that qualified for the study, including 109 Endotak Reliance leads, 1 Sprint Quattro Secure lead, 2 Durata leads, 1 Riata ST lead, and no Sprint Fidelis lead. The sign of calcification was a gradual increase in shocking or pacing impedance. Average implant time was 7.4 ± 3.1 (range: 1.3-16.5) years. Only Endotak Reliance leads had shocking coil calcification (n = 72; 66.0%) and five (6.9%) of these failed defibrillation threshold (DFT) testing. Distal pacing electrode calcification affected 55 (50.4%) Endotak Reliance leads. The four other leads had pacing ring electrode calcification only.

31767523,Analysis of the Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database for Patient- and Circuit-Related Adverse Events Involving Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation.,"Nov, 2019","BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: We assessed commonly reported patient- and circuit-related adverse events involving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) devices by analyzing post-marketing surveillance data from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. ECMO is a rescue therapy for critically ill patients requiring oxygenation and cardiopulmonary support. Key configurations include veno-venous (VV) ECMO for respiratory support and veno-arterial (VA) ECMO for cardio-respiratory support. Robust data on the most commonly reported complications associated with ECMO therapy are limited. METHODS/MATERIALS: The MAUDE database was queried from January 1, 2009, through March 31, 2019, yielding 93 reports. After excluding duplicate reports, 82 reports were included in the final analysis. RESULTS: Percentages represent the proportion of total submitted MAUDE reports on ECMO. Of the reported cases, 24 were VV-ECMO, 8 were VA-ECMO, and the remainder were unspecified. The most commonly reported patient-related adverse events included hemodynamic decompensation of patients (12.2%), death (12.2%), atrial perforation (7.3%), and bleeding (7.3%). The most commonly reported failure modes were in the following circuit components: mechanical pump (19.5%, mostly due to technical failure or clots), membrane oxygenator (19.5%, mostly due to tear in the membrane or temperature probe), and access cannulae (18.3%, mostly due to structural damage). CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the MAUDE database demonstrates that in real-world practice, ECMO devices are associated with important complications. With broadened global utilization of ECMO devices, standard complication and failure reporting policies may improve patient selection, operator proficiency, and existing device technology. SUMMARY: An analysis of the Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database demonstrates that in real-world practice, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation devices are associated with serious complications.

31545350,Reported mortality with rotating sheaths vs. laser sheaths for transvenous lead extraction.,"Sep, 2019","AIMS: Rotating sheaths and laser sheaths are commonly used for transvenous lead extraction. This study aims to compare observed mortality between both approaches. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database was searched from 2011 to 2016 to determine number of deaths associated with each sheath. An independent analytics firm provided estimates for number of cases done, allowing calculation of market share. A sensitivity analysis was performed to determine relative risk (RR) of mortality at the calculated market share (36% rotating/64% laser) and two others. Additional sensitivity analyses assumed underreporting of deaths associated with rotating sheaths. An estimated 50 545 extractions were performed. Thirteen deaths were associated with rotating sheaths compared to 167 with laser sheaths. Of these, 92% (rotating) and 95% (laser) were due to cardiovascular injury. At the calculated market share, the RR of death was 7.2 times greater with laser sheaths [95% confidence interval (CI) 4.1-12.7, P < 0.0001]. At market share estimates of 25% rotating/75% laser and 45% rotating/55% laser, the RR of death with laser sheaths was 4.3 (95% CI 2.4-7.5, P < 0.0001) and 10.5 times greater (95% CI 6.0-18.5, P < 0.0001), respectively. The RR of death remained significant when assuming deaths with rotating sheaths were underreported and when deaths using both sheaths were attributed to the rotating sheath.

31493376,Complications and Litigation Associated With Injectable Facial Fillers: A Cross-Sectional Study.,"Sep, 2019","PURPOSE: Soft-tissue injectable fillers are a popular treatment option for patients seeking minimally invasive facial rejuvenation. The use of soft-tissue fillers has increased significantly in the past 10 years. In 2017 alone, clinicians administered nearly 2.7 million soft-tissue fillers, up from 1.3 million in 2007. Although injectable fillers have a relatively high safety profile compared with more invasive rejuvenation procedures, serious adverse events, including intra-arterial injections, necrosis, and visual symptoms such as blindness, have been documented. Complications from injectable fillers have also been a source of litigation, which has been shown to be associated with a perceived lack of informed consent. We sought to document the reported complication rates associated with injectable facial fillers from a national database and to report on the available cases of malpractice litigation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The US Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database was used to collect the reported complications from 2013 to 2017 for the following injectable fillers: Artefill, Bellafill, Belotero, Juvederm, Radiesse, Restylane, Sculptra, and Kybella. Complications were organized by filler type, injection location, and complication type. The Thomson Reuters Westlaw Edge database was used to collect the reported jury verdicts and settlements from 2008 to 2017 for injectable facial fillers. RESULTS: A total of 2813 adverse events were analyzed. The most common locations for complications were the cheek (915 [32.5%]), lips (503 [17.9%]), and nasolabial fold (412 [14.6%]). The commonly reported adverse events were swelling (1,691 [60.1%]), nodule (948 [33.7%]), and pain (636 [22.6%]). Severe complications included intra-arterial injections resulting in necrosis and visual symptoms (eg, blurred vision and blindness). Forehead and dorsal nasal injections were significantly associated with intra-arterial complications resulting in necrosis and visual symptoms (P < .01). Injections with Radiesse were significantly associated with intra-arterial injections resulting in necrosis and visual symptoms (P < .01). A total of 11 malpractice cases were analyzed. The median award in the cases resolved by a verdict in favor of the plaintiff or settlement was $600,000. In 10 of the 11 cases, a lack of informed consent had been alleged. CONCLUSIONS: The complications associated with injectable facial fillers varied greatly, depending on factors involved with their application. The most common adverse effects were swelling, nodule formation, and pain. Serious complications stemming from intra-arterial injections included necrosis and visual disturbances, including blindness. These complications have been raised in legal cases, in which the lack of informed consent was frequently alleged.

31449789,Valuing innovative endoscopic techniques: endoscopic suturing to prevent stent migration for benign esophageal disease.,"Aug, 2019","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Reimbursement often presents a significant barrier to widespread adoption of innovative endoscopic devices. We aimed to determine the value (defined as cost savings to a payer) of endoscopic suturing devices in preventing the migration of esophageal stents placed for benign esophageal diseases. METHODS: A decision-analytic model was constructed from a payer perspective evaluating fully covered metal stent placement for benign esophageal diseases (fistula, leak, perforation, or stricture) in a hospital outpatient setting. The model compared 2 strategies: endoscopic suturing to anchor the stent or no suture. Health care outcomes and costs were derived from published systematic reviews and national databases (U.S. Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience [MAUDE] for safety data; 2018 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule and Provider Utilization and Payment Data databases for reimbursement data). RESULTS: From a payer perspective, reimbursement for care increased by US$1487.98 without endoscopic suturing per patient, compared with US$621.06 with endoscopic suturing, to cover the risk of stent migration in addition to usual professional and facility reimbursement for stent placement. Thus, an average cost saving of US$866.92 per patient was achieved with endoscopic suturing to reduce stent migration risks. Cost savings associated with suturing ranged from US$147.48 to US$1586.36 per patient, based on the indication for the procedure in sensitivity analysis. Cost savings increased with higher rates of technical success in suture placement.

Single-use products are regularly selected by agencies for resource-poor settings; the menstrual cup is a less known alternative. We reviewed international studies on menstrual cup leakage, acceptability, and safety and explored menstrual cup availability to inform programmes. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Popline, Cinahl, Global Health database, Emerald, Google Scholar, Science.gov, and WorldWideScience from database inception to May 14, 2019, for quantitative or qualitative studies published in English on experiences and leakage associated with menstrual cups, and adverse event reports. We also screened the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database from the US Food and Drug Administration for events related to menstrual cups. To be eligible for inclusion, the material needed to have information on leakage, acceptability, or safety of menstrual cups. The main outcome of interest was menstrual blood leakage when using a menstrual cup. Safety outcomes of interest included serious adverse events; vaginal abrasions and effects on vaginal microflora; effects on the reproductive, digestive, or urinary tract; and safety in poor sanitary conditions. Findings were tabulated or combined by use of forest plots (random-effects meta-analysis). We also did preliminary estimates on costs and environmental savings potentially associated with cups. This systematic review is registered on PROSPERO, number CRD42016047845. FINDINGS: Of 436 records identified, 43 studies were eligible for analysis (3319 participants). Most studies reported on vaginal cups (27 [63%] vaginal cups, five [12%] cervical cups, and 11 [25%] mixed types of cups or unknown) and 15 were from low-income and middle-income countries. 22 studies were included in qualitative or quantitative syntheses, of which only three were of moderate-to-high quality. Four studies made a direct comparison between menstrual cups and usual products for the main outcome of leakage and reported leakage was similar or lower for menstrual cups than for disposable pads or tampons (n=293). In all qualitative studies, the adoption of the menstrual cup required a familiarisation phase over several menstrual cycles and peer support improved uptake (two studies in developing countries).

31183792,Small bowel obstructions following the use of barbed suture: a review of the literature and analysis of the MAUDE database.,"Jun, 2019","BACKGROUND: Barbed suture has been adopted across all surgical specialties. One of the infrequent complications seen with the use of barbed suture is small bowel obstructions (SBOs). In this study, we perform a review of the literature and the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database (MAUDE) to characterize SBOs after the use of barbed sutures in a variety of operative procedures. METHODS: A review of the literature was performed by searching PubMed and Ovid. We used the search terms: ""barbed,"" ""suture,"" ""bowel,"" and ""obstructions."" For each case report, we examined the initial surgical procedure, type of barbed suture used, the type of complication, the time to complication, the presentation, and the type of operative interventions required. We did the same with the MAUDE database. RESULTS: Our review of the literature revealed 18 different cases of SBO secondary to the use of barbed suture. The four most common procedures, with a total of four cases each, were inguinal hernia procedures, myomectomy, hysterectomy, and pelvic floor reconstructive procedures. The average time of presentation to SBO was found to be 26.3 days post-op (1-196 days). A total of 16 patients (88.9%) presented with abdominal pain. Other common complaints included vomiting (33.3%), abdominal distension (27.8%), oral intolerance (22.2%), and constipation (16.7%). A total of 5 cases were also found to have a possible volvulus on computed tomography (CT), and 2 cases were reported to have strangulation. The MAUDE database had 14 cases reporting on obstruction. CONCLUSIONS: Surgeons should have a high index of suspicion for SBO if a patient presents with obstructive symptoms after a surgery that used barbed suture. This will often present as a mesenteric volvulus on CT.

31189203,Building Usability Knowledge for Health Information Technology: A Usability-Oriented Analysis of Incident Reports.,"Jun, 2019","BACKGROUND: The contribution of usability flaws to patient safety issues is acknowledged but not well-investigated. Free-text descriptions of incident reports may provide useful data to identify the connection between health information technology (HIT) usability flaws and patient safety. OBJECTIVES: This article examines the feasibility of using incident reports about HIT to learn about the usability flaws that affect patient safety. We posed three questions: (1) To what extent can we gain knowledge about usability issues from incident reports? (2) What types of usability flaws, related usage problems, and negative outcomes are reported in incidents reports? (3) What are the reported usability issues that give rise to patient safety issues? METHODS: A sample of 359 reports from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database was examined. Descriptions of usability flaws, usage problems, and negative outcomes were extracted and categorized. A supplementary analysis was performed on the incidents which contained the full chain going from a usability flaw up to a patient safety issue to identify the usability issues that gave rise to patient safety incidents. RESULTS: A total of 249 reports were included. We found that incident reports can provide knowledge about usability flaws, usage problems, and negative outcomes. Thirty-six incidents report how usability flaws affected patient safety (ranging from incidents without consequence, to death) involving electronic patient scales, imaging systems, and HIT for medication management.

30924953,Lasers and energy-based devices marketed for vaginal rejuvenation: A cross-sectional analysis of the MAUDE database.,"Mar, 2019","INTRODUCTION: The FDA issued a statement on July 30, 2018, expressing concern over the marketing of lasers and energy-based devices to promote ""vaginal rejuvenation."" The FDA stated that there is insufficient data to recommend this modality for optimization of sexual function and alleviation of genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM)-related symptoms in postmenopausal or postpartum women. This analysis aims to characterize the mandatory and voluntary reports concerning laser and energy-based procedures marketed for vaginal rejuvenation. METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of the FDA database, Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE), for events related to laser and energy-based devices for vaginal rejuvenation. RESULTS: Between October 2015 and January 2019, 45 distinct events describing 46 patients were recorded and reviewed. The most commonly reported adverse event related to the procedure was pain (vulvar, bladder, urethral, or unspecified) (n = 19). The majority of patients sought medical care for their injuries, which included evaluation by urgent care, urology, gynecology, neurology, gastroenterology, pelvic floor therapy, primary care providers, and the device operator. Thirty-three patients indicated chronicity of their injury, which included long-term pain, numbness, burning, bladder disturbances, infections, scarring, dyspareunia, worsening symptoms, aggravation of lichen sclerosis, and disfigurement. CONCLUSIONS: A variety of adverse events associated with the use of laser and energy-based devices for ""vaginal rejuvenation"" was reported to the MAUDE database.

30841006,Understanding Health Information Technology Induced Medication Safety Events by Two Conceptual Frameworks.,"Mar, 2019","BACKGROUND: While health information technology (health IT) is able to prevent medication errors in many ways, it may also potentially introduce new paths to errors. To understand the impact of health IT induced medication errors, this study aims to conduct a retrospective analysis of medication safety reports. METHODS: From the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database, we identified reports in which health IT is a contributing factor to medication errors. We applied two conceptual frameworks, Sittig and Singh's sociotechnical model and Coiera's information value chain, to examine the identified reports. RESULTS: We identified 152 unique reports on health IT induced medication errors as the final report set for review. The majority (65.13%) of the reports involved multiple contributing factors according to the sociotechnical model. Three dimensions, that is, clinical content, human-computer interface, and people, were involved in more reports than the others. The transition of the effects of health IT on medication practice was summarized using information value chain. Health IT related contributing factors may lead to receiving wrong information, missing information, receiving partial information and delayed information, and receiving wrong information and missing information tend to cause the commission errors in decision-making. CONCLUSION: The two frameworks provide an opportunity to understand a comprehensive context of safety event and the impact of health IT induced errors on medication safety.

30772531,Internal insulation breaches in an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator lead with redundant conductors.,"Feb, 2019","BACKGROUND: Internal insulation breaches (IBR) may result in implantable cardioverter-defibrillator lead failure and adverse clinical events. Concerns exist that the Durata lead may be prone to IBR. OBJECTIVE: The goals of this study were to assess Durata failures in the Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database and compare them to failures in MAUDE for Endotak Reliance and Sprint Quattro Secure (QS) leads. METHODS: We searched the MAUDE database from 2008 to 2018 for IBR and other failure modes. Included were explanted leads whose manufacturers found an insulation or conductor defect not caused by extrinsic factors. RESULTS: The MAUDE search found 1011 qualifying leads. The cause of failure differed among leads (P < .001). The primary cause of Durata failure was IBR (293 of 316 leads [93%]), with IBR accounting for 47% (137 of 293); few QS (9 of 523 [1.7%]) and no Endotak Reliance leads failed because of IBR (P < .001). Durata IBR were responsible for 11 failures to treat ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation, and all were caused by high-voltage (HV) shorts between the proximal superior vena cava coil and a distal right ventricular coil cable (n = 10) or sensing conductor (n = 1); low values of HV impedance were found in these leads during defibrillation threshold testing (n = 3), after a shock or aborted shock (n = 7), and by an alert (n = 1). Inappropriate therapy was caused by 51 Durata IBR, but no QS IBR. CONCLUSION: Durata implantable cardioverter-defibrillator leads are susceptible to IBR that may result in failure to treat ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation or inappropriate therapy; such failures may occur without forewarning.

30640660,Retrospective analysis of complications associated with dorsal root ganglion stimulation for pain relief in the FDA MAUDE database.,"Jan, 2019","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Dorsal root ganglion stimulation is an emerging therapy in the treatment of chronic pain. Compared with traditional spinal cord stimulation, it allows a discretely targeted stimulation profile and may act via differing mechanisms of action. Despite these advantages, little is known about the complications associated with this new modality. METHODS: We queried the MAUDE (Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience) database for all entries named 'Dorsal root ganglion stimulator for pain relief' reported between May 1, 2016 and December 31, 2017. We verified these data through the Office of the Freedom of Information Act at the US Food and Drug Administration. We then eliminated duplicate entries and categorized each complication based on the event description. A secondary analysis was performed to characterize the serious adverse events and the severity of new neurologic symptoms and infections. RESULTS: We identified 979 unique episodes following our process of deduplication. Almost half (47%) of entries were categorized as device-related complications, a quarter (28%) as procedural complications, with the remainder as patient complaints (12%), serious adverse events (2.4%), and 'other' complications (4.6%). The majority of complications were managed surgically with revision (n = 488; 49.8%) rather than explant (n = 161; 16.4%) events, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The 'Dorsal root ganglion stimulator for pain relief' device has been publicized as a breakthrough in neuromodulation technologies.

30617505,Robotic sacrocolpopexy: adverse events reported to the FDA over the last decade.,"Jan, 2019","INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: As surgeons increase the volume of robotic abdominal sacrocolpopexies (rASCs) and become more experienced, a subsequent decrease in the number of adverse events is expected over time. Further, as the leading manufacturer of the operative robot (Intuitive Surgical) improves the technology, adverse events should also decrease. We hypothesized that there has been a decrease in adverse event reporting for rASCs and that serious adverse events are rare. METHODS: We performed a search of the FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. All entries with the manufacturer ""Intuitive Surgical"" were exported from 2007 to 2017. All entries with ""sacrocolpopexy"" were then isolated and analyzed. RESULTS: The number of adverse events reported for rASC peaked in 2013 and 2014, at 107 and 124 respectively. In 2015 and 2016, the number dropped to 11 and 7 respectively. There were 334 reported adverse events from 2007 to 2017. Five (1.50%) were categorized as death, 33 (9.88%) as injury, and 296 (88.62%) as malfunction. Analysis of the malfunction reports found that 15 out of 296 (5.07%) were converted to open surgery, 4 out of 296 (1.3%) were converted to laparoscopic surgery, 4 out of 296 (1.3%) cases were aborted, and 6 out of 296 (2.03%) malfunctions resulted in patient injury. CONCLUSIONS: Although the MAUDE database has its limitations, it does indicate that the number of adverse events reported for rASC peaked in 2013 and 2014 and has decreased annually since then. This may be due to improved proficiency of the surgeon and surgical team, in addition to improvements in the robot.

30466818,Timely recognition of total elbow and radial head arthroplasty adverse events: an analysis of reports to the US Food and Drug Administration.,"Nov, 2018","BACKGROUND: Recent recalls of several commonly used elbow arthroplasty implants have prompted interest in the modes by which elbow implants fail and the timing of reports of these failures. METHODS: We reviewed the adverse event reports to the US Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database from 2012 to 2015 regarding elbow arthroplasty to determine the event date and the type of each adverse event. RESULTS: Among 179 total elbow adverse event reports, the most common modes of failure were implant dissociation (23%), loosening (22%), and infection (16%). The most common modes of failure among 58 radial head replacement reports were component dissociation (19%) and linkage screw failure (19%). The percentage distribution of adverse event types differed among different arthroplasty systems and from that reported in published reviews of elbow arthroplasty. Three implant recalls were implemented 2, 5, and 9 years after the first adverse event report in the MAUDE database. For 2 of the recalls, the first reports of the device failures were published 2 and 5 years after the first MAUDE reports. CONCLUSIONS: The MAUDE database is a publicly funded and publicly available means by which surgeons can identify adverse events for the prostheses they use before such information becomes available through journal publication or recall notification. In this study, MAUDE data revealed a higher relative frequency of mechanical dissociation of elbow implants than what has been represented in the literature.

30402576,Biliary and pancreatic lithotripsy devices.,"Nov, 2018","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Lithotripsy is a procedure for fragmentation or destruction of stones to facilitate their removal or passage from the biliary or pancreatic ducts. Although most stones may be removed endoscopically using conventional techniques such as endoscopic sphincterotomy in combination with balloon or basket extraction, lithotripsy may be required for clearance of large, impacted, or irregularly shaped stones. Several modalities have been described, including intracorporeal techniques such as mechanical lithotripsy (ML), electrohydraulic lithotripsy (EHL), and laser lithotripsy, as well as extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL). METHODS: In this document, we review devices and methods for biliary and pancreatic lithotripsy and the evidence regarding efficacy, safety, and financial considerations. RESULTS: Although many difficult stones can be safely removed using ML, endoscopic papillary balloon dilation (EPBD) has emerged as an alternative that may lessen the need for ML and also reduce the rate of adverse events. EHL and laser lithotripsy are effective at ductal clearance when conventional techniques are unsuccessful, although they usually require direct visualization of the stone by the use of cholangiopancreatoscopy and are often limited to referral centers.

30387234,Guidewire fracture during orbital atherectomy for peripheral artery disease: Insights from the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database.,"Nov, 2018","BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Orbital atherectomy (OA) is routinely being used for plaque modification to facilitate percutaneous revascularization in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and arterial calcification. Guidewire fracture (GWF) during OA, though anecdotally described, has not been studied in a systematic manner. We conducted a review of the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database to study the reports of wire fracture and its management and consequences. METHODS: We queried the MAUDE database for all events involving the current generation of the OA device: ""Diamondback 360 Peripheral Orbital Atherectomy System"", and ""Stealth 360° Orbital PAD System"". RESULTS: We identified 62 reports of GWF during OA for PAD. The superficial femoral artery was the most commonly involved atherectomy site. The wire fractured at the soft tip in a majority of cases (68%). Embolized wire fragments were left in the patient in 36 cases (58%), retrieved percutaneously in 10 cases (16%), and trapped by a stent against the arterial wall in eight cases (13%). Lastly, eight patients (13%) underwent surgery for removal of the wire fragment. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first published report to study the complication of GWF during peripheral OA. GWF is an uncommon but has significant procedural and clinical consequences. It results in a high rate of ancillary rescue procedures (including surgery) and is associated with a higher risk of arterial thrombosis and complications from wire retrieval attempts.

30308590,An Analysis of the FDA MAUDE Database and the Search for Cobalt Toxicity in Class 3 Johnson & Johnson/DePuy Metal-on-Metal Hip Implants.,"Oct, 2018","INTRODUCTION: This study was designed to determine whether systemic cobalt toxicity as an adverse event could be documented using the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database for cobalt-chromium containing hip implant recipients. Class 3 Johnson & Johnson (J&J)/DePuy devices were chosen for analysis because of the large number of adverse event reports related to their Pinnacle and ASR XL Acetabular hip replacement systems. A secondary goal was to characterize the reporters who are populating the information in the MAUDE database and to evaluate the quality of the data and information submitted. METHODS: Using FDA MAUDE downloadable data files, 83,528 adverse event medical device narrative reports were identified with the product code of KWA (Prosthesis, Hip, Semiconstrained [Metal Uncemented Acetabular Component]) for J&J/DePuy (KWA Text File). These are class 3 devices and devices with known high failure rates. The ASR XL Acetabular hip replacement Systems and Pinnacle fall into this category. This group of implants was chosen because implant failure is associated with elevated cobalt levels. Two additional subfiles were created from Free Text records in the narrative reports containing key words that indicated a chromium or cobalt (CrCo) device and another for key words indicating elevated levels of cobalt or toxicity. These files were then searched for symptoms of systemic cobalt toxicity with Microsoft Excel using key words pertaining to symptom categories of: cognitive/memory loss, tremor, neuropathy, depression, auditory symptoms, visual symptoms, cardiac, and thyroid disease. Reports are submitted to the FDA at the device component level. It was common for multiple reports to be submitted for a single device. RESULTS: It was not possible to differentiate systemic versus local symptoms for adverse event reports in the neuropathy category. This category was not analyzed. The number of adverse event reports in the other categories ranged from 119 to 16 for the J&J/DePuy KWA Text File and 59 to 4 in the file of records having key words indicating potential elevation of CrCo or toxicity. Cardiac, visual, and auditory conditions were most frequently reported. With the possible exception of cardiomyopathy, the numbers of these reports are far below the prevalence expected in the general population of comparable age. The content of the MAUDE database records often contained little objective data. We found less than 4% of 14,714 records, which indicated cobalt elevation or toxicity contained units for quantitative measurement. There was also frequent use of nondescript, all-encompassing words and phrases such as ""mental anguish,"" found in 321 KWA Text File records. Manufacturers submitted more than 99% of the reports and the most common reporter occupation was attorney, found in 42.24% of the 83,550 J&J/DePuy KWA Reporter File records. Physician was the reporter's occupation in 20.48% of reports but seldom reported directly to the FDA. CONCLUSIONS: We were not able find in the FDA MAUDE database meaningful warning signs to support the contention that chromium-cobalt-containing Class 3 J&J and DePuy hip implants caused systemic neurological or thyroid symptoms in patients. The incidence of reported cardiomyopathy was rare but frequent enough to be cause of concern. The redaction of most patient data along with the nonstructured nature of data entry would be expected to hinder the identification of warning signs. Even identification of the type of device could not be consistently carried out. In addition, the FDA needs to implement a methodology to identify and group all reports from a single device implanted into a patient, so duplication of event counting would not occur. Of 83,550 J&J/DePuy KWA Reporter File records, we found only two physician reports sent directly to the FDA.

31984352,Toward safer health care: a review strategy of FDA medical device adverse event database to identify and categorize health information technology related events.,"Oct, 2018","INTRODUCTION: Health information technology (HIT) is intended to provide safer and better care to patients. However, poorly designed or implemented HIT poses a key risk to patient safety. It is essential for healthcare providers and researchers to investigate the HIT-related events. Unfortunately, the lack of HIT-related event databases in the community hinders the analysis and management of HIT-related events. OBJECTIVES: Develop a standardized process for identifying HIT-related events from a Federal Drug Administration (FDA) database in order to create an HIT exclusive database for analysis and learning. METHODS: The FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database, containing over 7-million reports about medical device malfunctions and problems leading to serious injury or death, was considered as a potential resource to identify HIT-related events. We developed a strategy of identifying and categorizing HIT-related events from the FDA reports through the application of a keyword filter and standardized expert review. Ten percent identified reports were reviewed to measure the consistency among experts and to initialize a database for HIT-related events. RESULTS: With the proposed strategy, we initialized an HIT-related event database with over 3500 reports, and updated the estimation of the HIT-related event proportion in the FDA MAUDE database to 0.46∼0.69%, up to 50,000 HIT-related events. CONCLUSION: The proposed strategy for HIT-related event identification holds promise in aiding the understanding, characterization, discovery, and reporting of HIT-related events toward improved patient safety.

29922850,Safety of orogastric tubes in foregut and bariatric surgery.,"Jun, 2018","BACKGROUND: Orogastric tubes have traditionally aided foregut procedures with sizing and organ protection. The rise of bariatric surgery has led to the creation of novel medical devices aimed at facilitating the laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. While approved by the FDA, the long-term safety profile of these devices in the general population is often unknown. This review looks at complications associated with novel Orogastric Tubes compared to the traditional bougie. METHODS: We performed a review of the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database for complications associated with the traditional bougie, Boehringer Labs ViSiGi 3D® and the Medtronic GastriSail™ since 2011. In addition, we looked for reported cases in the literature of complications with these devices. RESULTS: Overall complication rates reported in the MAUDE database varied in number and severity. The bougie had seven reported complications, one of which was an organ perforation. The ViSiGi 3D® had zero reported complications. The GastriSail™ had 36 total reported complications with 17 perforations. A literature review shows that rates of bougie complications are extremely rare with no case reports or reviews of complications from the novel orogastric tubes.

29930960,"A Primer to the Structure, Content and Linkage of the FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) Files.","Jun, 2018","INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND: The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database is a publicly available resource providing over 4 million records relating to medical device safety. Using downloadable MAUDE files avoids limitations of the online MAUDE search interface. However, naive file usage can result in errors, while independent discovery of the nuances required to correctly work with the database can be time-consuming. Practical information is provided to shorten this learning curve and obtain accurate results when using the MAUDE database files. MAUDE FILE DESCRIPTIONS: The MAUDE database consists of 135 fields in four primary (Master Event, Device, Patient, Text) and two supplemental (Device Problems and Problem Code Descriptions) file types. When combined, these six files provide a detailed account of an adverse event or product problem report. Website instructions for joining the files are incomplete.

29759905,Analysis of 4063 complications of shoulder arthroplasty reported to the US Food and Drug Administration from 2012 to 2016.,"May, 2018","BACKGROUND: Most of the literature on shoulder arthroplasty failure comes from high-volume centers. These reports tend to exclude the experience of community orthopedic surgeons, who perform most of the shoulder joint replacements. METHODS: We analyzed the failure reports mandated by the US Food and Drug Administration for all hospitals. Each reported event from 2012 to 2016 was characterized by implant, failure mode, and year of surgery. RESULTS: For the 1673 anatomic arthroplasties, the most common failure modes were glenoid component failure (20.4%), rotator cuff/subscapularis tear (15.4%), pain/stiffness (12.9%), dislocation/instability (11.8%), infection (9%), and humeral component loosening (5.1%). For the 2390 reverse arthroplasties, the most common failure modes were dislocation/instability (32%), infection (13.8%), glenosphere-baseplate dissociation (12.2%), failed/loosened baseplate (10.4%), humeral component dissociation/tray fracture (5.5%), difficulty inserting the baseplate (4.8%), and difficulty inserting the glenosphere (4.2%). Although the percentage distribution among the different failure modes was relatively consistent over the years of this study, the percentage distribution of these failure modes differed substantially among different implant manufacturers. CONCLUSIONS: The Food and Drug Administration database reveals modes of shoulder arthroplasty failure that are not emphasized in the published literature, such as rotator cuff tear, infection, and postoperative pain/stiffness for anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty and implant dissociation and baseplate failure for reverse shoulder arthroplasty.

29653650,Comparison of adverse event and device problem rates for transcatheter aortic valve replacement and Mitraclip procedures as reported by the Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry and the Food and Drug Administration postmarket surveillance data.,"Apr, 2018","BACKGROUND: Although outcomes data on transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and transcatheter mitral valve repair (Mitraclip) are available via the Transcatheter Valve Therapy (TVT) registry, dissemination of TVT data is often delayed. The Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) system collects postmarket outcomes data in public medical device reports. We used natural language processing to compare the event rates for TAVR and Mitraclip in the TVT registry and from MAUDE data. METHODS: We identified all medical device reports related to TAVR and Mitraclip from December 2011 through December 2014. Our primary objective was to demonstrate that event rates in TVT and MAUDE were not significantly different. We also compared TVT event rates for TAVRs performed in 2014 to MAUDE-derived event rates for the Sapien XT and CoreValve devices, both Food and Drug Administration-approved in 2014. RESULTS: Regression analysis demonstrated close correlation between TVT and MAUDE rates for both TAVR and Mitraclip, with R CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that natural language processing technology sorted through raw MAUDE data, allowing identification of the most common events associated with TAVR and Mitraclip procedures, and that MAUDE-derived event rates were not statistically significantly different from TVT event rates.

Erosion into the esophagus is an important complication to recognize and is reported to occur at very low incidences (0.1-0.15%). Characterization of this complication remains limited. We aim to describe the worldwide experience with erosion of the magnetic sphincter augmentation device including presentation, techniques for removal, and possible risk factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed data obtained from the device manufacturer Torax Medical, Inc., as well as the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. The study period was from February 2007 through July 2017 and included all devices placed worldwide. RESULTS: In total, 9453 devices were placed and there were 29 reported cases of erosions. The median time to presentation of an erosion was 26 months with most occurring between 1 and 4 years after placement. The risk of erosion was 0.3% at 4 years after device implantation. Most patients experienced new-onset dysphagia prompting evaluation. Devices were successfully removed in all patients most commonly via an endoscopic removal of the eroded portion followed by a delayed laparoscopic removal of the remaining beads. At a median follow-up of 58 days post-removal, there were no complications and 24 patients have returned to baseline. Four patients reported ongoing mild dysphagia.

29520389,An evaluation of the Manufacturer And User Facility Device Experience database that inspired the United States Food and Drug Administration's Reclassification of transvaginal mesh.,"Mar, 2018","PURPOSE: To assess the utility of the Manufacturer And User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database in objectively capturing adverse events for transvaginal mesh in the United States. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed 1,103 individual medical device reports submitted to the MAUDE database that inspired the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration's 2008 Public Health Notification. Entries were compiled into a categorical database that reported manufacturer, brand, reporter type, report source, and type of adverse event. RESULTS: There were numerous examples of missing, duplicated, and non-standardized entries. Analysis revealed 64 reports with duplicated information, and six reports representing multiple patients. Forty-seven percent of medical device reports did not identify a reporter source. At least 28% of reported devices are no longer on the US market. There was wide variability in the quality and completeness of submitted reports and true adverse event rates could not be accurately calculated because the number of total cases was unknown. CONCLUSIONS: The MAUDE database was limited in its ability to collect, quantify, and standardize real-life adverse events related to transvaginal mesh. While it functions to collect information related to isolated adverse events, systematic limitations of the MAUDE database, that no doubt extend to other medical devices, necessitate the development of new reporting systems.

METHODS: We utilized a mixed-methods approach to systematically characterize structured data and text narratives associated with IV-PCA events submitted to MAUDE between 1 January 2011 and 12 September 2016. RESULTS: Of 1,430 IV-PCA events reported during the study period, 6.4% were adverse events (AEs) as identified via structured data fields in the MEDWATCH forms. Upon qualitative review of the narrative texts, 11.0% of events were associated with an unfavorable clinical outcome, which was 71% higher than the incidence of the adverse outcomes reported using the structured data fields. Device-related issues, which were mostly preventable, accounted for 86.9% of events. Of 65 reportable events submitted by manufacturers, 18.5% did not comply with reporting requirements as mandated by law.

29411167,Investigation of adverse events associated with an off-label use of arterial stents and CE-marked iliac vein stents in the iliac vein: insights into developing a better iliac vein stent.,"Feb, 2018","We analyzed the adverse events associated with an off-label use of arterial stents and CE-marked iliac vein stents for the treatment of iliac venous thromboembolism and investigated their relationships with the anatomical features of the iliac vein, to gain insights into the development of a better iliac vein stent. Reports of adverse events following the use of stents in the iliac vein were retrieved from the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database that contain suspected device-associated complications reported to the Food and Drug Administration. Data from 2006 to 2016 were investigated. The literature analysis was also conducted using PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Web of Science focusing on English articles published up to 4 October 2016. The analysis of 88 adverse events from the MAUDE database and 182 articles from the literature revealed that a higher number of adverse events had been reported following the use of arterial stents in the iliac vein compared to CE-marked iliac vein stents. While stent migration and shortening were reported only for the arterial stents, stent fracture and compression occurred regardless of the stent type, even though a vein does not pulsate. A study of the anatomical features of the iliac vein implies that bending, compression, and kink loads are applied to the iliac vein stents in vivo. For designing, developing, and pre-clinical testing of stents intended for use in the iliac vein, the above mechanical load environments induced by the anatomical features should be considered.",No Full Text Available,investigation of adverse events associated with an offlabel use of arterial stents and cemarked iliac vein stents in the iliac vein insights into developing a better iliac vein stent,we analyzed the adverse events associated with an offlabel use of arterial stents and cemarked iliac vein stents for the treatment of iliac venous thromboembolism and investigated their relationships with the anatomical features of the iliac vein to gain insights into the development of a better iliac vein stent reports of adverse events following the use of stents in the iliac vein were retrieved from the manufacturer and user facility device experience maude database that contain suspected deviceassociated complications reported to the food and drug administration data from  to  were investigated the literature analysis was also conducted using pubmed cochrane library embase and web of science focusing on english articles published up to  october  the analysis of  adverse events from the maude database and  articles from the literature revealed that a higher number of adverse events had been reported following the use of arterial stents in the iliac vein compared to cemarked iliac vein stents while stent migration and shortening were reported only for the arterial stents stent fracture and compression occurred regardless of the stent type even though a vein does not pulsate a study of the anatomical features of the iliac vein implies that bending compression and kink loads are applied to the iliac vein stents in vivo for designing developing and preclinical testing of stents intended for use in the iliac vein the above mechanical load environments induced by the anatomical features should be considered,investigation adverse event associated offlabel use arterial stent cemarked iliac vein stent iliac vein insight developing better iliac vein stent analyzed adverse event associated offlabel use arterial stent cemarked iliac vein stent treatment iliac venous thromboembolism investigated relationship anatomical feature iliac vein gain insight development better iliac vein stent report adverse event following use stent iliac vein retrieved manufacturer user facility device experience maude database contain suspected deviceassociated complication reported food drug administration data investigated literature analysis also conducted using pubmed cochrane library embase web science focusing english article published october analysis adverse event maude database article literature revealed higher number adverse event reported following use arterial stent iliac vein compared cemarked iliac vein stent stent migration shortening reported arterial stent stent fracture compression occurred regardless stent type even though vein pulsate study anatomical feature iliac vein implies bending compression kink load applied iliac vein stent vivo designing developing preclinical testing stent intended use iliac vein mechanical load environment induced anatomical feature considered,Stent Fracture Adverse Events
29345415,Investigating Complications Associated With Occipital Nerve Stimulation: A MAUDE Study.,"Jan, 2018","OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study are to utilize the MAUDE data base to enhance our understanding of the complication profile for Occipital Nerve Stimulation, a therapy for which the current level of evidence is limited. Additionally, it is our objective to describe a systematic approach to processing the MAUDE data, which addresses its flaws and enhances its utility. METHODS: From the FDA website, we accessed adverse events reports from the MAUDE data base for devices used in Occipital Nerve Stimulation between June 30, 2007 and June 30, 2017. All reports were sorted into an overall classification for types of adverse events, types of patient complaints, and types of specific device-related complications. We then evaluated for the total number of adverse event reports that contained each of the patient complains and device-related complications. RESULTS: A total of 1233 adverse event records were obtained. Eight hundred twenty-two records were classified as surgically manageable post-operative complications, 121 as device malfunction, 29 as patient compliance issues, and 27 as intra-operative complications. Two hundred thirty-seven records were not classified. A total of 683 records contained patient complaints including 467 complaints of ineffective stimulation, 122 complaints of inappropriate or over-stimulation, 50 complaints of device-shock, and 44 complaints of IPG site pain. We found 581 post-operative device-related complications, which included 206 instances of lead migration, 157 reports of lead erosion, 155 infections, 46 lead-fractures, and 17 lead disconnections. CONCLUSION: The MAUDE data base is a useful tool to investigate device related complications and helps fill the current gap in ONS data.

The procedures reviewed were performed on patients at locations throughout the United States from January 2006 to December 2016. Data collection was completed in March 2017. The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database, which contains medical device reports submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), was searched for complications that occurred from January 2006 to December 2016 involving facial implants made by Implantech, MEDPOR, Stryker, KLS Martin, and Synthes. Furthermore, the Thomson Reuters Westlaw legal database was searched for relevant litigation. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The complications of facial implants were analyzed in relation to the location of implant and severity of complication. Litigation was analyzed to determine which factors determine outcome. RESULTS: Thirty-nine instances of adverse events reported to the FDA were identified. Sixteen (41%) involved malar implants, followed by 12 chin implants (31%). The most common complications included infection (18 [46%]), implant migration (9 [23%]), swelling (7 [18%]), and extrusion (4 [10%]). Thirty-two patients (83%) had to have their implants removed. Infection occurred at a mean (SD) of 83.3 (68.8) days following the surgery. One-third of complications involved either migration or extrusion. The mean (range) time to migration or extrusion was 381.1 (10-2400) days. In 12 malpractice cases identified in publicly available court proceedings, alleged inadequate informed consent and requiring additional surgical intervention (ie, removal) were the most commonly cited factors. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Infection and implant migration or extrusion are the most common complications of facial implants. Most of these complications necessitate removal. These considerations need to be discussed with patients preoperatively as part of the informed consent process, as allegedly inadequate informed consent was cited in a significant proportion of resultant litigation, and there were overlapping considerations among adverse events reported to the FDA and factors brought up in relevant litigation. Cases resolved with settlements and jury-awarded damages encompassed considerable award totals.

29270603,A Cross-sectional Analysis of Adverse Events and Litigation for Injectable Fillers.,"Dec, 2017","IMPORTANCE: Injectable fillers are increasing in popularity as a noninvasive option to address concerns related to facial aging and volume loss. To our knowledge, there have been no large-scale analyses of adverse events and associated litigation related to filler injections. OBJECTIVES: To determine risks of injectable fillers and analyze factors raised in litigation related to injectable fillers. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cross-sectional review, the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) manufacturer and user facility device experience (MAUDE) database was evaluated for complications from the use of the following fillers: Juvederm, Restylane, Belotero, Sculptra, Radiesse, Artefill, Bellafill, and Juvederm Voluma from 2014 to 2016. The Westlaw Next database was used to identify jury verdicts. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Complications were organized by type of filler used, location of injection, and severity. Intra-arterial injections without sequelae and those resulting in blindness or necrosis were considered severe complications. Factors raised during the litigation process were also analyzed. RESULTS: Of 1748 adverse events analyzed, most cases stemmed from cheek (751 [43.0%]) or lip (524 [30.0%]) injection. Commonly reported adverse events reported included swelling (755 [43.2%]) and infection (725 [41.5%]). Among FDA-reported complications, blindness was significantly associated with dorsal nasal injections (P < .001). Vascular compromise with and without sequela of dermal necrosis and blindness were significantly associated with Radiesse injections P < .001. Of the 9 malpractice cases identified, two-thirds involved allegations of inadequate informed consent, and the median award in cases resolved with payment was $262 000. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Although specific complication profiles vary by material and injection site, common adverse events associated with injectable fillers include swelling and infection. More serious events include vascular compromise, resulting in necrosis and blindness; these events are also raised in cases involving litigation. This analysis illustrates the importance of outlining these risks in a comprehensive preoperative informed consent process.

29232174,Analysis of Reported Balloon Malfunctions and Proposed Rescue Strategy for Malfunction during Airway Dilation.,"Dec, 2017","Objective The rate of balloon dilator failure is unknown, and a rescue strategy for device malfunction has not been established. The purposes of this investigation were to determine the approximate number of balloon failures in the gastrointestinal tract and airway, evaluate the parameters required to rupture balloon dilators, and develop a rescue strategy to efficiently reestablish airway patency. Study Design Retrospective cohort and basic medical research. Setting Academic tertiary care medical center. Subjects and Methods The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database was queried for adverse events associated with tracheal and esophageal dilators between January 1, 2014, and January 1, 2017. A bench-top model of airway stenosis was developed, and optimal conditions for the safe removal of a malfunctioning dilator were assessed (2, 4, 6 atm). Results There were 420 reported balloon malfunctions, including 104 cases with deflation/removal issues. The bench-top model determined that device rupture allowing for immediate removal occurs with needle puncture at balloon pressures ≥8 atm. Balloons inflated to 6 atm required a median of 17.5 seconds (range, 0-55.3) for removal, in comparison with 30.2 seconds (range, 7.1-87.5) at 2 atm ( P > .05). Conclusion Balloon dilator malfunction is a significant problem that practitioners must be prepared for. Pressure ≥8 atm (~33% overinflation) is required to consistently cause complete balloon dilator rupture via needle puncture. While counterintuitive, increasing the inflation pressure of a malfunctioning balloon (8-10 atm) may expedite rupture and safe removal.

29065635,Surgeon Training in Telerobotic Surgery via a Hardware-in-the-Loop Simulator.,"Oct, 2017","This work presents a software and hardware framework for a telerobotic surgery safety and motor skill training simulator. The aims are at providing trainees a comprehensive simulator for acquiring essential skills to perform telerobotic surgery. Existing commercial robotic surgery simulators lack features for safety training and optimal motion planning, which are critical factors in ensuring patient safety and efficiency in operation. In this work, we propose a hardware-in-the-loop simulator directly introducing these two features. The proposed simulator is built upon the Raven-II™ open source surgical robot, integrated with a physics engine and a safety hazard injection engine. Also, a Fast Marching Tree-based motion planning algorithm is used to help trainee learn the optimal instrument motion patterns.

It is a complex multistep procedure requiring several classes of instruments that are subject to operator misuse and device malfunction. We report device-related adverse events during PCNL from the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database using a recently developed standardized classification system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MAUDE database was queried for ""percutaneous nephrolithotomy"" from 2006 to 2016. The circumstances and patient complications associated with classes of devices used during PCNL were identified. We then utilized a novel MAUDE classification system to categorize clinical events. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify associations between device classes and severe adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 218 device-related events were reported. The most common classes included: lithotripter 53 (24.3%), wires 43 (19.7%), balloon dilators 30 (13.8%), and occlusion balloons 28 (12.8%). Reported patient complications included need for a second procedure 12 (28.6%), bleeding 8 (19.0%), retained fragments 7 (16.7%), prolonged procedure 4 (9.5%), ureteral injury 2 (4.8%), and conversion to an open procedure 3 (7.1%). Using a MAUDE classification system, 176 complications (81%) were Level I (mild/none), 26 (12%) were Level II (moderate), 15 (7%) were Level III (severe), and 1 (0.5%) was Level IV (life threatening). On univariate analysis, balloon dilators had the highest risk of Level II-IV complications compared with the other device classes [odds ratio: 4.33, confidence interval: 1.978, 9.493, p < 0.001]. The device was evaluated by the manufacturer in 93 (42.7%) cases, with 54.8% of reviewed cases listing the source of malfunction as misuse by the operator.

28802790,Vascular air embolism: A silent hazard to patient safety.,"Aug, 2017","PURPOSE: To narratively review published information on prevention, detection, pathophysiology, and appropriate treatment of vascular air embolism (VAE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: MEDLINE, SCOPUS, Cochrane Central Register and Google Scholar databases were searched for data published through October 2016. The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was queried for ""air embolism"" reports (years 2011-2016). RESULTS: VAE may be introduced through disruption in the integrity of the venous circulation that occurs during insertion, maintenance, or removal of intravenous or central venous catheters. VAE impacts pulmonary circulation, respiratory and cardiac function, systemic inflammation and coagulation, often with serious or fatal consequences. When VAE enters arterial circulation, air emboli affect cerebral blood flow and the central nervous system. New medical devices remove air from intravenous infusions. Early recognition and treatment reduce the clinical sequelae of VAE. An organized team approach to treatment including clinical simulation can facilitate preparedness for VAE. The MAUDE database included 416 injuries and 95 fatalities from VAE. Data from the American Society of Anesthesiologists Closed Claims Project showed 100% of claims for VAE resulted in a median payment of $325,000.

28679898,Pharmacovigilance Mobile Tool Design in the Field of Arhroplasty.,"Jul, 2017","Pharmacovigilance is an important part of the patient safety and it has a great appeal to physicians. It is concerned with the safety of medical devices and treatments in the light of understanding the risks and dangers based on the already reported safety issues. Internet resources such as the Manufacturer And User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) web-site are often retrieved due to the lack of internal, local safety databases. The research looked at how Human Computer Interaction could improve user experience. We have designed data entry for safety reporting and pharmacovigilance based on the web-bases system called WebBISS (Web-based implant search system).

28731889,Stent thrombosis with bioabsorbable polymer drug-eluting stents: insights from the Food and Drug Administration database.,"Jul, 2017","BACKGROUND: SYNERGY, a bioabsorbable polymer-based, everolimus-eluting stent (BP-DES), recently received regulatory approval in the USA for use in percutaneous coronary interventions. Yet, information on the safety of BP-DES in routine clinical practice is limited. Our aim was to compare the safety of the recently approved BP-DES with current durable polymer drug-eluting stents (DP-DES) by analyzing adverse events, namely, stent thrombosis (ST), reported to the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MAUDE database requires nationwide mandatory notification for adverse events on devices approved for clinical use. This database was searched for adverse events reported between 1 October 2015 and 25 December 2016, encountered after the placement of either BP-DES or DP-DES. Only those adverse events were included where the exposure period to the stents was comparable after the index procedure. Of all the adverse events reported, the event of interest was ST. RESULTS: A total of 951 adverse events were reported. ST occurred in 48/951 of all events, 31/309 and 17/642 when BP-DES or DP-DES were used, respectively (P=0.00001). Of the 31 ST events with BP-DES, 68% (21/31) occurred within less than or equal to 24 h of the index procedure and 52% (16/31) occurred within less than or equal to 2 h. CONCLUSION: Our results raise the possibility of an increased risk of ST, particularly early ST (within 24 h), with the recently approved BP-DES. However, because of the inherent limitations of reporting within the MAUDE database, these data merely highlight a potential need for additional surveillance and randomized trials to assess further the safety of the bioabsorbable platform.",No Full Text Available,stent thrombosis with bioabsorbable polymer drugeluting stents insights from the food and drug administration database,background synergy a bioabsorbable polymerbased everolimuseluting stent bpdes recently received regulatory approval in the usa for use in percutaneous coronary interventions yet information on the safety of bpdes in routine clinical practice is limited our aim was to compare the safety of the recently approved bpdes with current durable polymer drugeluting stents dpdes by analyzing adverse events namely stent thrombosis st reported to the manufacturer and user facility device experience maude database materials and methods the maude database requires nationwide mandatory notification for adverse events on devices approved for clinical use this database was searched for adverse events reported between  october  and  december  encountered after the placement of either bpdes or dpdes only those adverse events were included where the exposure period to the stents was comparable after the index procedure of all the adverse events reported the event of interest was st results a total of  adverse events were reported st occurred in  of all events  and  when bpdes or dpdes were used respectively p of the  st events with bpdes   occurred within less than or equal to  h of the index procedure and   occurred within less than or equal to  h conclusion our results raise the possibility of an increased risk of st particularly early st within  h with the recently approved bpdes however because of the inherent limitations of reporting within the maude database these data merely highlight a potential need for additional surveillance and randomized trials to assess further the safety of the bioabsorbable platform,stent thrombosis bioabsorbable polymer drugeluting stent insight food drug administration database background synergy bioabsorbable polymerbased everolimuseluting stent bpdes recently received regulatory approval usa use percutaneous coronary intervention yet information safety bpdes routine clinical practice limited aim compare safety recently approved bpdes current durable polymer drugeluting stent dpdes analyzing adverse event namely stent thrombosis st reported manufacturer user facility device experience maude database material method maude database requires nationwide mandatory notification adverse event device approved clinical use database searched adverse event reported october december encountered placement either bpdes dpdes adverse event included exposure period stent comparable index procedure adverse event reported event interest st result total adverse event reported st occurred event bpdes dpdes used respectively p st event bpdes occurred within le equal h index procedure occurred within le equal h conclusion result raise possibility increased risk st particularly early st within h recently approved bpdes however inherent limitation reporting within maude database data merely highlight potential need additional surveillance randomized trial ass safety bioabsorbable platform,Stent Fracture Adverse Events

28533700,Risk management and regulations for lower limb medical exoskeletons: a review.,"May, 2017","Gait disability is a major health care problem worldwide. Powered exoskeletons have recently emerged as devices that can enable users with gait disabilities to ambulate in an upright posture, and potentially bring other clinical benefits. In 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration approved marketing of the ReWalk™ Personal Exoskeleton as a class II medical device with special controls. Since then, Indego™ and Ekso™ have also received regulatory approval. With similar trends worldwide, this industry is likely to grow rapidly. On the other hand, the regulatory science of powered exoskeletons is still developing. The type and extent of probable risks of these devices are yet to be understood, and industry standards are yet to be developed. To address this gap, Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience, Clinicaltrials.gov, and PubMed databases were searched for reports of adverse events and inclusion and exclusion criteria involving the use of lower limb powered exoskeletons. Current inclusion and exclusion criteria, which can determine probable risks, were found to be diverse. Reported adverse events and identified risks of current devices are also wide-ranging. In light of these findings, current regulations, standards, and regulatory procedures for medical device applications in the USA, Europe, and Japan were also compared. There is a need to raise awareness of probable risks associated with the use of powered exoskeletons and to develop adequate countermeasures, standards, and regulations for these human-machine systems.

28413855,Frequency of pacemaker malfunction associated with monopolar electrosurgery during pulse generator replacement or upgrade surgery.,"Apr, 2017","PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to investigate the frequency of electrosurgery-related pacemaker malfunction. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted to investigate electrosurgery-related pacemaker malfunction in consecutive patients undergoing pulse generator (PG) replacement or upgrade from two large hospitals in Minneapolis, MN between January 2011 and January 2014. The occurrence of this pacemaker malfunction was then studied by using MAUDE database for all four major device vendors. RESULTS: A total of 1398 consecutive patients from 2 large tertiary referral centers in Minneapolis, MN undergoing PG replacement or upgrade surgery were retrospectively studied. Four patients (0.3% of all patients), all with pacemakers from St Jude Medical (2.8%, 4 of 142) had output failure or inappropriately low pacing rate below 30 bpm during electrosurgery, despite being programmed in an asynchronous mode. During the same period, 1174 cases of pacemaker malfunctions were reported on the same models in MAUDE database, 37 of which (3.2%) were electrosurgery-related. Twenty-four cases (65%) had output failure or inappropriate low pacing rate. The distribution of adverse events was loss of pacing (59.5%), reversion to backup pacing (32.4%), inappropriate low pacing rate (5.4%), and ventricular fibrillation (2.7%). The majority of these (78.5%) occurred during PG replacement at ERI or upgrade surgery. No electrosurgery-related malfunction was found in MAUDE database on 862 pacemaker malfunction cases during the same period from other vendors.

28430558,Lower Esophageal Sphincter Augmentation for Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease: The Safety of a Modern Implant.,"Apr, 2017","INTRODUCTION: Use of the magnetic sphincter augmentation device (MSAD) for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is increasing. As this innovative treatment for GERD gains widespread use and adoption, an assessment of its safety since U.S. market introduction is presented. METHODS: Events were collected from the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database, which reports events submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of suspected device-associated deaths, serious injuries, and malfunctions. The reporting period was from March 22, 2012 (FDA approval) through May 31, 2016, and included only events occurring in the United States. Additional information was provided by the manufacturer, allowing calculation of implant rates and durations. RESULTS: An estimated 3283 patients underwent magnetic sphincter augmentation (165 surgeons at 191 institutions). The median implant duration was 1.4 years, with 1016 patients implanted for at least 2 years. No deaths, life-threatening events, or device malfunctions were reported. The overall rate of device removal was 2.7% (89/3283). The most common reasons for device removal were dysphagia (52/89) and persistent reflux symptoms (19/89). Removal for erosion and migration was 0.15% (5/3283) and 0% (0/3283), respectively. There were no perforations. Of the device removals, 57.3% (51/89) occurred <1 year after implant, 30.3% (27/89) between 1 and 2 years, and 12.4% (11/89) >2 years after implant. The rate of device removal and erosion with an implant duration >2 years were 1.1% (11/1016) and 0.1% (1/1016), respectively. All device removals and erosions were managed nonemergently, with no complications or long-term consequences. CONCLUSIONS: During a 4-year period in more than 3000 patients, no unanticipated MSAD complications have emerged, and there is no data to suggest a trend of increased events over time. The presentation and management of device-related issues have been less complicated than revisions for laparoscopic fundoplication or other interventions for GERD.

28416466,Risk of atrioesophageal fistula formation with contact force-sensing catheters.,"Apr, 2017","BACKGROUND: Atrioesophageal fistula formation is a rare but life-threatening complication of atrial fibrillation ablation. Contact force (CF)-sensing catheters improve procedural effectiveness. However, the impact of the implementation of CF-sensing technology on the risk of atrioesophageal fistula formation has not been explored. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the association between the use of CF-sensing catheters and atrioesophageal fistula development. METHODS: We searched the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database for adverse event reports involving Food and Drug Administration-approved ablation catheters. RESULTS: Among 2689 device reports, we identified 78 atrioesophageal fistula cases, 65 of which involved CF-sensing catheters and 13 non-CF-sensing catheters. The percentage of total reports involving atrioeosphageal fistula was 5.4% for CF-sensing catheters (65 of 1202) and 0.9% for non-CF-sensing catheters (13 of 1487) (P < .0001). Procedural details (CF and power settings) were not consistently reported. Esophageal temperature increases were detected in only 2.5% of cases (2 of 78). The mean time to presentation was 16 ± 9 days. Overall mortality was at least 56%, with patients who underwent surgical repair more likely to survive than those treated with stenting or no intervention. CONCLUSION: Atrioesophageal fistula formation accounted for a much higher proportion of reported adverse events with CF-sensing catheters compared with non-CF-sensing catheters.

28249869,Update on Effectiveness of an Electromagnetic Feeding Tube-Placement Device in Detecting Respiratory Placements.,"Mar, 2017","BACKGROUND: Radiography is the accepted gold standard for testing feeding tube placement; however, an electromagnetic tube-placement device (ETPD) is sometimes used in lieu of radiography for this purpose. High success rates have been reported when the device was used by well-trained individuals. However, authors previously described 20 cases that occurred between 2007 and 2012 in which clinicians voluntarily reported inability to detect inadvertent tube insertions in the respiratory tract while using an ETPD. OBJECTIVE: To describe case reports to the US Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database between 2013 and 2015 regarding inadvertent respiratory placement of feeding tubes by operators using an ETPD. METHODS: The MAUDE database was searched for cases dated from January 1, 2013, through December 31, 2015, along with selected brand names. A total of 34 cases (25 after removal of duplicates) were located in which a feeding tube was inserted into the respiratory tract during insertions assisted by an ETPD. RESULTS: Sites of the malpositioned tubes included the right lung (n = 13), left lung (n = 6), unspecified lung (n = 4), and bronchus (n = 2). A pneumothorax occurred in 17 of the 25 misplacements; feedings were administered in 6 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Many case reports involved clinicians failing to recognize tube misplacements in the respiratory tract while using an ETPD.

28249868,Cortrak-Assisted Feeding Tube Insertion: A Comprehensive Review of Adverse Events in the MAUDE Database.,"Mar, 2017","BACKGROUND: Electromagnetic devices to guide feeding tube placement such as the CORTRAK Enteral Access System have shown promising results; however, researchers in recent studies have expressed concern that a higher level of user expertise may be required for safe use. OBJECTIVES: To review adverse events related to CORTRAK-assisted feeding tube insertion reported in the Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. METHODS: A retrospective, secondary analysis of the MAUDE database was performed to evaluate adverse events (ie, injury or death of patient) related to CORTRAK. RESULTS: Fifty-four adverse events between January 1, 2006 and February 29, 2016 were identified and reviewed. Most events (98%) involved feeding tube placement in the lungs (37%, left lung; 46%, right lung; 15%, not specified). Lung complications included pneumothorax (77%) and pneumonitis (21%). Death occurred in 17% of lung placements. Clinicians failed to recognize placement in 89% of CORTRAK insertion tracings reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: Lung placement is not unique to CORTRAK and is an inherent risk of all feeding tube insertions.

37592616,Lessons Learned from the MAUDE Database on Transvaginal Synthetic Mesh and Sling Reports.,"Mar, 2017","INTRODUCTION: We investigated the volume and sources of MDRs (medical device reports) on transvaginal mesh and sling complications in the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) MAUDE (Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience) database. METHODS: We extracted and analyzed reports on transvaginal mesh and sling complications submitted to the MAUDE database from 2008 to 2014. We also examined reports for major mesh and sling brands as well as reporter occupation. RESULTS: The number of reports on transvaginal mesh and sling implants increased slowly from 2008 to 2011, ending with 1,687 reports in 2011. In 2012 the volume increased nearly sevenfold, yielding 11,710 reports. The year 2013 witnessed an even greater surge, with a total of 43,680 complication reports. This trend quickly subsided in 2014 as the number of reports decreased to 5,467. Meanwhile, the number of attorney submitted reports greatly increased by a factor of 18.6 in 2012 and then by a smaller increment in 2013. Physician submitted reports increased threefold in 2012 and then by a factor of 5.6 in 2013. Unfortunately more than half of the 2013 reports list an unknown occupation for the reporter. CONCLUSIONS: The marked growth of transvaginal mesh and sling reports in the MAUDE database, as well as attorney submitted reports, correlated with the timing of the 2011 FDA issued notification warning the public about the risk of complications associated with transvaginal mesh placement.

28157770,Global Adverse Event Reports of Breast Implant-Associated ALCL: An International Review of 40 Government Authority Databases.,"Feb, 2017","BACKGROUND: Tracking world cases of breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is currently limited to patient registries at a few academic centers, dependent upon patient referral and case reports in the literature. The purpose of this study was to review and compare federal database adverse event reports of breast implant-associated ALCL encompassing the major breast implant markets worldwide. METHODS: Federal implantable device regulatory bodies were contacted and database queries were performed for 40 countries. Demographics, device characteristics, pathology, treatment modalities, and outcomes were assessed when available. RESULTS: For the countries queried, 363 unique cases were reported for breast implant-associated ALCL. Search terms ""anaplastic"" and ""ALCL"" were queried of the U.S. Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database and yielded 258 unique cases as of September 2015, of which only 130 had pathologic markers performed. Implant surface was textured significantly more than smooth (50 percent versus 4.2 percent; p = 0.0001). Treatment, when reported (n = 136), included explantation [n = 125 (91.9 percent)], chemotherapy [n = 42 (30.8 percent)], radiation therapy [n = 25 (18.4 percent)], and/or stem cell transplant [n = 9 (6.6 percent)], and five deaths were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Federal reporting of breast implant-associated ALCL has limitations in providing clinical history, treatment, and oncologic follow-up.

27979446,"Adverse Events Involving Radiation Oncology Medical Devices: Comprehensive Analysis of US Food and Drug Administration Data, 1991 to 2015.","Dec, 2016","PURPOSE: Radiation oncology relies on rapidly evolving technology and highly complex processes. The US Food and Drug Administration collects reports of adverse events related to medical devices. We sought to characterize all events involving radiation oncology devices (RODs) from the US Food and Drug Administration's postmarket surveillance Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database, comparing these with non-radiation oncology devices. METHODS AND MATERIALS: MAUDE data on RODs from 1991 to 2015 were sorted into 4 product categories (external beam, brachytherapy, planning systems, and simulation systems) and 5 device problem categories (software, mechanical, electrical, user error, and dose delivery impact). Outcomes included whether the device was evaluated by the manufacturer, adverse event type, remedial action, problem code, device age, and time since 510(k) approval. Descriptive statistics were performed with linear regression of time-series data. Results for RODs were compared with those for other devices by the Pearson χ RESULTS: There were 4234 ROD and 4,985,698 other device adverse event reports. Adverse event reports increased over time, and events involving RODs peaked in 2011. Most ROD reports involved external beam therapy (50.8%), followed by brachytherapy (24.9%) and treatment planning systems (21.6%). The top problem types were software (30.4%), mechanical (20.9%), and user error (20.4%). RODs differed significantly from other devices in each outcome (P<.001). RODs were more likely to be evaluated by the manufacturer after an event (46.9% vs 33.0%) but less likely to be recalled (10.5% vs 37.9%) (P<.001). Device age and time since 510(k) approval were shorter among RODs (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with other devices, RODs may experience adverse events sooner after manufacture and market approval.

27913723,The Utility of the MAUDE Database for Osseointegrated Auditory Implants.,"Dec, 2016","OBJECTIVE: To determine the utility of Manufacturer and User Friendly Device Experience (MAUDE) database in studying osseointegrated auditory implant (OAI)-related complications. METHODS: The MAUDE database was searched for all reports involving OAIs (ie, Baha, Ponto, Sophono). Complications were classified into 1 or more of 6 categories-implant, abutment, processor, skin, surgery, and other. Subcategories were generated to prevent overgeneralization. Other variables recorded included date of report, number of complications per report, manufacturer, and time from complication to report. RESULTS: Over the study period, there were 269 complications listed from 238 reports divided into the following categories: implant related (n = 145), abutment related (n = 16), processor related (n = 13), skin and soft tissue related (n = 79), surgery related (n = 11), and other (n = 5). No demographic data were available. There were no discernible trends from the data, and when compared to published literature, MAUDE data appear to under- or misrepresent complications. CONCLUSION: The MAUDE database is limited in its design and given fairly disparate reporting quality may not be ideally suited for quantifying risks of OAIs.

27806637,"Development of a Classification Scheme for Examining Adverse Events Associated with Medical Devices, Specifically the DaVinci Surgical System as Reported in the FDA MAUDE Database.","Nov, 2016","OBJECTIVE: To examine the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database (MAUDE) database to capture adverse events experienced with the Da Vinci Surgical System. In addition, to design a standardized classification system to categorize the complications and machine failures associated with the device. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Overall, 1,057,000 DaVinci procedures were performed in the United States between 2009 and 2012. Currently, no system exists for classifying and comparing device-related errors and complications with which to evaluate adverse events associated with the Da Vinci Surgical System. METHODS: The MAUDE database was queried for events reports related to the DaVinci Surgical System between the years 2009 and 2012. A classification system was developed and tested among 14 robotic surgeons to associate a level of severity with each event and its relationship to the DaVinci Surgical System. Events were then classified according to this system and examined by using Chi-square analysis. RESULTS: Two thousand eight hundred thirty-seven events were identified, of which 34% were obstetrics and gynecology (Ob/Gyn); 19%, urology; 11%, other; and 36%, not specified. Our classification system had moderate agreement with a Kappa score of 0.52. Using our classification system, we identified 75% of the events as mild, 18% as moderate, 4% as severe, and 3% as life threatening or resulting in death. Seventy-seven percent were classified as definitely related to the device, 15% as possibly related, and 8% as not related. Urology procedures compared with Ob/Gyn were associated with more severe events (38% vs 26%, p < 0.0001). Energy instruments were associated with less severe events compared with the surgical system (8% vs 87%, p < 0.0001). Events that were definitely associated with the device tended to be less severe (81% vs 19%, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Our classification system is a valid tool with moderate inter-rater agreement that can be used to better understand device-related adverse events.

BACKGROUND: In rare diseases and conditions, it is typically not feasible to conduct large-scale safety trials before drug or device approval. Therefore, post-market surveillance mechanisms are necessary to detect rare but potentially serious adverse events. METHODS: We reviewed the United States Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database and conducted a structured literature review to evaluate adverse events associated with on- and off-label Melody® valve implantation. Adverse events were compared with those described in the prospective Investigational Device Exemption and Post-Market Approval Melody® transcatheter pulmonary valve trials. RESULTS: We identified 631 adverse events associated with ""on-label"" Melody® valve implants and 84 adverse events associated with ""off-label"" implants. The most frequent ""on-label"" adverse events were similar to those described in the prospective trials including stent fracture (n=210) and endocarditis (n=104). Previously unrecognised or under-recognised adverse events included stent fragment embolisation (n=5), device erosion (n=4), immediate post-implant severe valvar insufficiency (n=2), and late coronary compression (n=2 cases at 5 days and 3 months after implantation). Under-recognised adverse events associated with off-label implantation included early valve failure due to insufficiency when implanted in the tricuspid position (n=7) and embolisation with percutaneous implantation in the mitral position (n=5).

27705733,A standardized surgical technique for removal of the Interstim tined lead.,"Oct, 2016","INTRODUCTION: Explantation of the Interstim sacral neuromodulation (SNM) device is occasionally necessary. Removing the tined lead can put strain on the lead, resulting in a possible break and retained fragments. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a notification regarding health consequences related to retained lead fragments. We describe a novel and safe surgical technique for removing the Interstim device and permanent lead. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database for complications related to tined lead removal and searched the database of a single surgeon at our institution. Our standardized technique for tined lead removal is as follows. An incision is made over the previous lead insertion site and the lead is isolated and externalized. The fibrous encapsulation is dissected off the lead to expose the tines and ensure the lead is free from adhesions. The lead is removed by wrapping it around a curved hemostat and turning it under tension. If the lead breaks, the incision is extended and dissection is carried down to the sacral body to remove all fragments. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients had their tined lead removed between 2009 and 2015 after being in place a median of 2.00 years (IQR 1.32-3.32 years).

27703419,Spontaneous Fractures of a Modern Modular Uncemented Femoral Stem.,"Oct, 2016","BACKGROUND: Femoral stem fracture following total hip arthroplasty is an uncommon event that requires immediate revision surgery. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We report on four patients who experienced stem fractures of one design and a review of the US Food and Drug Administration adverse event reports on this design. METHODS: Fracture surfaces of four EMPERION™ (Smith & Nephew, Memphis, TN) femoral stems were analyzed under optical and scanning electron microscopy. A search of the FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) that reports on all EMPERION™ adverse events was completed. RESULTS: Fracture surfaces exhibited characteristics consistent with a fatigue fracture mechanism. Sixteen MAUDE reports claimed stem fracture or breakage of EMPERION™ stems. CONCLUSION: The four cases of EMPERION™ stem fractures were likely driven by small stem diameter, high offset, and high patient weight.

27769853,Atrioesophageal fistula formation with cryoballoon ablation is most commonly related to the left inferior pulmonary vein.,"Oct, 2016","BACKGROUND: Collateral damage has been reported with use of the cryoballoon for pulmonary vein isolation. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence and characteristics associated with atrioesophageal fistula (AEF) after cryoballoon use. METHODS: Cases of AEF reported with use of the cryoballoon since 2011 were collected from the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database, publications, and the manufacturer's database. Lowest balloon temperatures were compared with matched control patients undergoing cryoballoon ablation without AEF formation. Location of AEF was compared with AEF associated with radiofrequency ablation. RESULTS: A total of 11 cases of AEF were identified from a worldwide experience that exceed 120,000 cases. Mean age was 60 (range 31-78 years), and 80% of patients were male. Although mean lowest balloon temperatures were no different between patients with AEF and those with no AEF (-58.5°C ± 7.2°C vs -56°C ± 2.6°C, P = NS), balloon inflation times were longer in patients with AEF (238.8 ± 54.8 seconds vs 178.1 ± 37.5 seconds in the non-AEF group, P ≤.001) All cases of AEF for which location was identified occurred in relation to the left pulmonary veins. The left inferior pulmonary vein (LIPV) was involved in 8 of 10 patients with cryoballoon compared to 0 of 11 patients in the radiofrequency group (P <.05). Mortality for cryoballoon-associated AEF was 64%. CONCLUSION: AEF after cryoballoon use is rare (<1 in 10,000) and most commonly was identified near the LIPV.

27097160,Adverse Events in Robotic Surgery: A Retrospective Study of 14 Years of FDA Data.,"Apr, 2016","BACKGROUND: Use of robotic systems for minimally invasive surgery has rapidly increased during the last decade. Understanding the causes of adverse events and their impact on patients in robot-assisted surgery will help improve systems and operational practices to avoid incidents in the future. METHODS: By developing an automated natural language processing tool, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the adverse events reported to the publicly available MAUDE database (maintained by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) from 2000 to 2013. We determined the number of events reported per procedure and per surgical specialty, the most common types of device malfunctions and their impact on patients, and the potential causes for catastrophic events such as patient injuries and deaths. RESULTS: During the study period, 144 deaths (1.4% of the 10,624 reports), 1,391 patient injuries (13.1%), and 8,061 device malfunctions (75.9%) were reported. The numbers of injury and death events per procedure have stayed relatively constant (mean = 83.4, 95% confidence interval (CI), 74.2-92.7 per 100,000 procedures) over the years. Surgical specialties for which robots are extensively used, such as gynecology and urology, had lower numbers of injuries, deaths, and conversions per procedure than more complex surgeries, such as cardiothoracic and head and neck (106.3 vs. 232.9 per 100,000 procedures, Risk Ratio = 2.2, 95% CI, 1.9-2.6). Device and instrument malfunctions, such as falling of burnt/broken pieces of instruments into the patient (14.7%), electrical arcing of instruments (10.5%), unintended operation of instruments (8.6%), system errors (5%), and video/imaging problems (2.6%), constituted a major part of the reports. Device malfunctions impacted patients in terms of injuries or procedure interruptions. In 1,104 (10.4%) of all the events, the procedure was interrupted to restart the system (3.1%), to convert the procedure to non-robotic techniques (7.3%), or to reschedule it (2.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Despite widespread adoption of robotic systems for minimally invasive surgery in the U.S., a non-negligible number of technical difficulties and complications are still being experienced during procedures.

27027151,Insulin Pump Malfunction During Hospitalization: Two Case Reports.,"Mar, 2016","BACKGROUND: Insulin pump malfunctions and failures continue to occur; however, more severe malfunctions such as the ""runaway pump"" phenomenon are rarely reported. This article describes two cases of pump malfunction in which pump users appear to have received an unsolicited bolus of insulin resulting in severe episodes of hypoglycemia during hospitalization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Both cases of insulin pump malfunction occurred in the inpatient setting at a large academic medical center in the United States. An analysis of the corresponding insulin pump downloads was performed. The Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was searched for similar cases involving Medtronic (Northridge, CA) insulin pumps using the terms ""pump,"" ""infusion,"" ""insulin AND malfunction AND Medtronic."" RESULTS: The two cases described show remarkable similarities, each demonstrating a severe hypoglycemic event preceded by an infusion site change followed by an alarm. In both cases a rapid spraying of insulin was reported. The insulin pump downloads validated much of the patients' and medical staff's descriptions of events. The FDA's MAUDE database search revealed 425 cases meeting our search term criteria. All cases were reviewed. Seven cases were identified involving independent movement of the reservoir piston. CONCLUSIONS: The cases detailed are the first to describe an insulin pump malfunction of this nature in the hospital setting involving unsolicited insulin boluses leading to severe hypoglycemia.

26888235,Analysis of adverse events with use of orthodontic sequential aligners as reported in the manufacturer and user facility device experience database.,"Feb, 2016","BACKGROUND: Sequential aligners (SAs) introduced about a decade ago, changed the practice of orthodontics as we knew it but the adverse events and reactions (AER) associated with SA is not known. The Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database is a reliable database that has AERs reported. The manuscript attempts to review the AER associated with SA using the MAUDE database. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors downloaded and reviewed the SA-related AER from MAUDE for a period of 5 years. In-depth analysis of the site and nature of intraoral and extraoral AERs were performed. We attempted to calculate the probability of pathologies being directly related to SA use, using Bayes' theorem. RESULTS: In the study period of 5 years, 175 cases of AER registered with MAUDE database owing to use of SA. Of the 175 cases, 129 (73.71%) instances were mandatory reports filed by the manufacturer. Of all AERs, 32 (18.29%) cases had been diagnosed/suspected to have an allergic reaction, 20 (11.43%) of them with anaphylactic reaction and 4 (2.29%) of them with angioedema. Lesions involving tongue, throat, and lip such as soreness, inflammation, and hives were more commonly reported. In addition, 12 cases (6.86%) reported of nausea, 11 (6.29%) of gastrointestinal issues (stomach upset, diarrhea, and vomiting), 13 (7.43%) of neuromuscular issues (muscle cramps, spasm, and pain), 13 (7.43%) of cough, 10 (5.71%) of persistent headache, 3 (1.71%) of fever, and 12 (6.86%) of cardiac-related issues were identified. CONCLUSIONS: The AERs associated with SA has been described.

26888238,Adverse events associated with ultrasonic scalers: A manufacturer and user facility device experience database analysis.,"Feb, 2016","BACKGROUND: The present study was conducted to determine the frequency and type of adverse events (AEs) associated with ultrasonic scaler reported to the Food and Drug Administration manufacturer and user facility device experience (MAUDE) database. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors reviewed the ultrasonic scaler units (USU) related AEs reported to MAUDE from October 1, 1995, to September 31, 2015. Analyses of details collected are presented. RESULTS: MAUDE received a total of 667 unique USU-related AE reports. Of 667 cases, MAUDE classified 628 instances (94.2%) as malfunction 27 (4%) as injurious, 10 (1.5%) as others, and 2 (0.3%) claiming the use of USU as cause of death. Of the 667 cases, 511 (76.6%) were used for endodontic application, and 147 (22%) as scaler applications. In 512 (76.8%) instances, there was separation of the tips, posing danger to patients or users, and 112 (16.8%) instances of overheating, 12 (1.8%) instances of breakage, and electrical issues in 8 (1.2%) instances. These AE resulted in 19 instances of thermal injury, 2 suspicious deaths, and hearing loss in 3 cases. In 4 cases, patient swallowed broken parts requiring additional medical care. CONCLUSIONS: Use of USU, a Class 2 device without exemption, carries a degree of risk to patient's safety, if not properly used.

26850819,Adverse events of gastric electrical stimulators recorded in the Manufacturer and User Device Experience (MAUDE) Registry.,"Feb, 2016","UNLABELLED: The role of gastric electrical stimulation for patients with refractory symptoms of gastroparesis remains controversial. Open label studies suggest benefit while randomized controlled trials did not demonstrate differences between active and sham intervention. Using a voluntary reporting system of the Federal Drug Administration, we examined the type and frequency of adverse events. METHODS: We conducted an electronic search of the Manufacturer and User Device Experience (MAUDE) databank using the keyword 'Enterra' for the time between January of 2001 and October of 2015. We abstracted information about the year of stimulator implantation, the year and type of adverse effect, the resulting intervention and outcome if available. RESULTS: A total of 1587 entries described adverse effects related the GES. Only 36 of the reports listed perioperative complications. The vast majority described problems that could be classified as patient concerns, local complications, or system failure. The most common problem related lack or loss of efficacy, followed by pain or complications affecting the pocket site. A subset of 801 reports provided information about the time between system implant and registration of concerns, which gradually declined over time. More than one third (35.7%) of the reported adverse events prompted surgical correction. CONCLUSION: The number of voluntarily reported adverse events and the high likelihood of repeated surgical interventions clearly demonstrate the potential downside of gastric electrical stimulation.

26814222,Ventilator-Related Adverse Events: A Taxonomy and Findings From 3 Incident Reporting Systems.,"Jan, 2016","BACKGROUND: In 2009, researchers from Johns Hopkins University's Armstrong Institute for Patient Safety and Quality; public agencies, including the FDA; and private partners, including the Emergency Care Research Institute and the University HealthSystem Consortium (UHC) Safety Intelligence Patient Safety Organization, sought to form a public-private partnership for the promotion of patient safety (P5S) to advance patient safety through voluntary partnerships. The study objective was to test the concept of the P5S to advance our understanding of safety issues related to ventilator events, to develop a common classification system for categorizing adverse events related to mechanical ventilators, and to perform a comparison of adverse events across different adverse event reporting systems. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of ventilator-related adverse events reported in 2012 from the following incident reporting systems: the Pennsylvania Patient Safety Authority's Patient Safety Reporting System, UHC's Safety Intelligence Patient Safety Organization database, and the FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database. Once each organization had its dataset of ventilator-related adverse events, reviewers read the narrative descriptions of each event and classified it according to the developed common taxonomy. RESULTS: A Pennsylvania Patient Safety Authority, FDA, and UHC search provided 252, 274, and 700 relevant reports, respectively. The 3 event types most commonly reported to the UHC and the Pennsylvania Patient Safety Authority's Patient Safety Reporting System databases were airway/breathing circuit issue, human factor issues, and ventilator malfunction events. The top 3 event types reported to the FDA were ventilator malfunction, power source issue, and alarm failure. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we found that (1) through the development of a common taxonomy, adverse events from 3 reporting systems can be evaluated, (2) the types of events reported in each database were related to the purpose of the database and the source of the reports, resulting in significant differences in reported event categories across the 3 systems, and (3) a public-private collaboration for investigating ventilator-related adverse events under the P5S model is feasible.",No Full Text Available,ventilatorrelated adverse events a taxonomy and findings from  incident reporting systems,background in  researchers from johns hopkins universitys armstrong institute for patient safety and quality public agencies including the fda and private partners including the emergency care research institute and the university healthsystem consortium uhc safety intelligence patient safety organization sought to form a publicprivate partnership for the promotion of patient safety ps to advance patient safety through voluntary partnerships the study objective was to test the concept of the ps to advance our understanding of safety issues related to ventilator events to develop a common classification system for categorizing adverse events related to mechanical ventilators and to perform a comparison of adverse events across different adverse event reporting systems methods we performed a crosssectional analysis of ventilatorrelated adverse events reported in  from the following incident reporting systems the pennsylvania patient safety authoritys patient safety reporting system uhcs safety intelligence patient safety organization database and the fdas manufacturer and user facility device experience database once each organization had its dataset of ventilatorrelated adverse events reviewers read the narrative descriptions of each event and classified it according to the developed common taxonomy results a pennsylvania patient safety authority fda and uhc search provided   and  relevant reports respectively the  event types most commonly reported to the uhc and the pennsylvania patient safety authoritys patient safety reporting system databases were airwaybreathing circuit issue human factor issues and ventilator malfunction events the top  event types reported to the fda were ventilator malfunction power source issue and alarm failure conclusions overall we found that  through the development of a common taxonomy adverse events from  reporting systems can be evaluated  the types of events reported in each database were related to the purpose of the database and the source of the reports resulting in significant differences in reported event categories across the  systems and  a publicprivate collaboration for investigating ventilatorrelated adverse events under the ps model is feasible,ventilatorrelated adverse event taxonomy finding incident reporting system background researcher john hopkins university armstrong institute patient safety quality public agency including fda private partner including emergency care research institute university healthsystem consortium uhc safety intelligence patient safety organization sought form publicprivate partnership promotion patient safety p advance patient safety voluntary partnership study objective test concept p advance understanding safety issue related ventilator event develop common classification system categorizing adverse event related mechanical ventilator perform comparison adverse event across different adverse event reporting system method performed crosssectional analysis ventilatorrelated adverse event reported following incident reporting system pennsylvania patient safety authority patient safety reporting system uhcs safety intelligence patient safety organization database fda manufacturer user facility device experience database organization dataset ventilatorrelated adverse event reviewer read narrative description event classified according developed common taxonomy result pennsylvania patient safety authority fda uhc search provided relevant report respectively event type commonly reported uhc pennsylvania patient safety authority patient safety reporting system database airwaybreathing circuit issue human factor issue ventilator malfunction event top event type reported fda ventilator malfunction power source issue alarm failure conclusion overall found development common taxonomy adverse event reporting system evaluated type event reported database related purpose database source report resulting significant difference reported event category across system publicprivate collaboration investigating ventilatorrelated adverse event p model feasible,Medical Device Safety Incidents

26660689,New Minimum Relative Humidity Requirements Are Expected to Lead to More Medical Device Failures.,"Dec, 2015","In 2010, the Addendum D to ASHRAE Standard 170, ""Ventilation of healthcare facilities,"" lowered the minimum relative humidity (RH) requirement of anesthetizing locations (including operating rooms, operating/surgical cystoscopic rooms, delivery rooms (Caesarean), recovery rooms, critical and intensive care, newborn intensive care, treatment rooms, trauma rooms (crisis or shock), laser eye rooms, newborn nursery suites, and endoscopy rooms) from 30 % to 20 %. The new minimum limit was adopted based on the results of a review paper that suggested that lowering humidity levels will have little or no impact on providing a safe environment for patients, staff, or medical equipment. That review paper reached this conclusion by assuming that there were no medical device failures due to electrostatic discharge (ESD).

26507706,Ureteral Avulsion Associated with Ureteroscopy: Insights from the MAUDE Database.,"Oct, 2015","BACKGROUND: Flexible and semirigid ureteroscopy (URS) are widely performed for the treatment of upper tract calculi and tumors. Ureteral avulsion is a rare, but devastating complication of endoscopic stone removal having multiple possible etiologies. Awareness and avoidance of this rare complication depend on identifying responsible mechanisms. This study examines the situations in which ureteral avulsion occurs as described anonymously in the Manufacturer and User facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MAUDE database was systematically reviewed to account for all reported complications of flexible and semirigid URS. Keywords ""ureteroscopy, injury, death, malfunction and other"" were entered in the database and medical device reports were reviewed to capture any cases resulting in ureteral avulsion. Attention was paid to the type of ureteroscope involved and the mechanism for avulsion. RESULTS: A total of 104 entries were found detailing the reported complications of flexible and semirigid URS. Ureteral avulsion was clearly noted in six reports with flexible (2) and semirigid ureteroscopes (4). Potential mechanisms included locked deflection of a flexible ureteroscope (1), bunching of the distal bending rubber in a flexible ureteroscope (1), scabbard avulsion (3), and stone basketing (1). CONCLUSIONS: Although the incidence of ureteral avulsion cannot truly be determined from this study, some potentially novel mechanisms for this rare complication are observed.

26467552,Structural Mechanics Predictions Relating to Clinical Coronary Stent Fracture in a 5 Year Period in FDA MAUDE Database.,"Oct, 2015","Endovascular stents are the mainstay of interventional cardiovascular medicine. Technological advances have reduced biological and clinical complications but not mechanical failure. Stent strut fracture is increasingly recognized as of paramount clinical importance. Though consensus reigns that fractures can result from material fatigue, how fracture is induced and the mechanisms underlying its clinical sequelae remain ill-defined. In this study, strut fractures were identified in the prospectively maintained Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database (MAUDE), covering years 2006-2011, and differentiated based on specific coronary artery implantation site and device configuration. These data, and knowledge of the extent of dynamic arterial deformations obtained from patient CT images and published data, were used to define boundary conditions for 3D finite element models incorporating multimodal, multi-cycle deformation. The structural response for a range of stent designs and configurations was predicted by computational models and included estimation of maximum principal, minimum principal and equivalent plastic strains. Fatigue assessment was performed with Goodman diagrams and safe/unsafe regions defined for different stent designs. Von Mises stress and maximum principal strain increased with multimodal, fully reversed deformation. Spatial maps of unsafe locations corresponded to the identified locations of fracture in different coronary arteries in the clinical database. These findings, for the first time, provide insight into a potential link between patient adverse events and computational modeling of stent deformation. Understanding of the mechanical forces imposed under different implantation conditions may assist in rational design and optimal placement of these devices.",No Full Text Available,structural mechanics predictions relating to clinical coronary stent fracture in a  year period in fda maude database,endovascular stents are the mainstay of interventional cardiovascular medicine technological advances have reduced biological and clinical complications but not mechanical failure stent strut fracture is increasingly recognized as of paramount clinical importance though consensus reigns that fractures can result from material fatigue how fracture is induced and the mechanisms underlying its clinical sequelae remain illdefined in this study strut fractures were identified in the prospectively maintained food and drug administrations fda manufacturer and user facility device experience database maude covering years  and differentiated based on specific coronary artery implantation site and device configuration these data and knowledge of the extent of dynamic arterial deformations obtained from patient ct images and published data were used to define boundary conditions for d finite element models incorporating multimodal multicycle deformation the structural response for a range of stent designs and configurations was predicted by computational models and included estimation of maximum principal minimum principal and equivalent plastic strains fatigue assessment was performed with goodman diagrams and safeunsafe regions defined for different stent designs von mises stress and maximum principal strain increased with multimodal fully reversed deformation spatial maps of unsafe locations corresponded to the identified locations of fracture in different coronary arteries in the clinical database these findings for the first time provide insight into a potential link between patient adverse events and computational modeling of stent deformation understanding of the mechanical forces imposed under different implantation conditions may assist in rational design and optimal placement of these devices,structural mechanic prediction relating clinical coronary stent fracture year period fda maude database endovascular stent mainstay interventional cardiovascular medicine technological advance reduced biological clinical complication mechanical failure stent strut fracture increasingly recognized paramount clinical importance though consensus reign fracture result material fatigue fracture induced mechanism underlying clinical sequela remain illdefined study strut fracture identified prospectively maintained food drug administration fda manufacturer user facility device experience database maude covering year differentiated based specific coronary artery implantation site device configuration data knowledge extent dynamic arterial deformation obtained patient ct image published data used define boundary condition finite element model incorporating multimodal multicycle deformation structural response range stent design configuration predicted computational model included estimation maximum principal minimum principal equivalent plastic strain fatigue assessment performed goodman diagram safeunsafe region defined different stent design von mi stress maximum principal strain increased multimodal fully reversed deformation spatial map unsafe location corresponded identified location fracture different coronary artery clinical database finding first time provide insight potential link patient adverse event computational modeling stent deformation understanding mechanical force imposed different implantation condition may assist rational design optimal placement device,Stent Fracture Adverse Events
26313491,Enmeshed in Controversy: Use of Vaginal Mesh in the Current Medicolegal Environment.,"Aug, 2015","UNLABELLED: Vaginal mesh has been a valuable tool in the treatment of stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. As our knowledge of the long-term outcomes and complications of this product has evolved, however, vaginal mesh has become the subject of legal scrutiny. Therefore, it is imperative that physicians understand pertinent litigation techniques to optimize their informed consent and documentation processes and protect themselves. OBJECTIVES: Our objective is to familiarize physicians who use vaginal mesh with how law suits involving transvaginal mesh are construed. We also describe the current medicolegal environment surrounding the use of these products. METHODS: The food and drug administration public safety communications, food and drug administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database, and LexisNexis legal search engine were used to review data relevant to current vaginal mesh litigation. This information was used to create a medicolegal review. RESULTS: Litigation involving transvaginal mesh follows 3 paths. The first consists of claims against the manufacture of transvaginal mesh with allegations, such as design defects, failure to warn, and misrepresentation. The second is a defensive legal strategy called the learned intermediary doctrine, used by manufacturers to shift liability from themselves to surgeons. The manufacturers claim that the duty to inform patients of potential complications lies with the surgeon. The third involves claims by patients against surgeons for lack of informed consent, alleging that they were not sufficiently informed of potential complications associated with transvaginal mesh before insertion.

26165944,User-reported abrasion-related lead failure is more common with durata compared to other implantable cardiac defibrillator leads.,"Jul, 2015","BACKGROUND: Following increased rates of inside-out abrasion with the St Jude Medical Riata lead, the Durata implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) lead was introduced with modifications intended to increase abrasion resistance. Recent case reports have described insulation failures of the Durata. OBJECTIVE: To determine if increased rates of abrasion-related failure are present with the Durata lead. METHODS: The Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database was queried for reports of insulation failure of the Durata lead from 2014. Comparison was made to other ICD leads. Incidence was estimated and case characteristics were compared. RESULTS: The estimated incidence of abrasion was significantly higher for the Durata lead than for the Boston Scientific Endotak or the Medtronic Quattro leads. The mode of abrasion was most often lead-to-can, as compared to ""inside-out"" abrasion with the Riata lead. Full-thickness abrasion was associated with failure to defibrillate or inappropriate therapy. Four patients had failure of therapy or death. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate higher rates of insulation failures of the Durata lead, despite design modifications. External abrasion from the pulse generator to the adjacent lead within the device pocket was the most common etiology.

26095572,Surgical Energy-Based Device Injuries and Fatalities Reported to the Food and Drug Administration.,"Jun, 2015","BACKGROUND: Energy-based devices are used in virtually every operation. Our purposes were to describe causes of energy-based device complications leading to injury or death, and to determine if common mechanisms leading to injury or death can be identified. STUDY DESIGN: The FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was searched for surgical energy-based device injuries and deaths reported over 20 years (January 1994 to December 2013). Device-related complications were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: We analyzed 178 deaths and 3,553 injuries. Common patterns of complications were: thermal burns, 63% (n = 2,353); hemorrhage, 17% (n = 642); mechanical failure of device, 12% (n = 442); and fire, 8% (n = 294). Events were identified intraoperatively in 82% (3,056), inpatient postoperatively in 9% (n = 351), and after discharge in 9% (n = 324). Of the deaths, 12% (n = 22) occurred after discharge home. Common mechanisms for thermal burn injuries were: direct application, 30% (n = 694); dispersive electrode burn, 29% (n = 657); and insulation failure, 14% (n = 324). Thermal injury was the most common reason for death (39%, n = 70). The mechanism for these thermal injuries was most frequently direct application (84%, n = 59, p < 0.001 vs all other mechanisms). Fires were most common with monopolar ""Bovie"" instruments (88%, n = 258, p < 0.001 vs all other devices) when they were used in head and neck operations (66%, n = 193, p < 0.001 vs all other locations). CONCLUSIONS: Complications due to energy-based devices occur from 4 main causes: thermal burn, hemorrhage, mechanical failure, and fire.

25987522,Complications of Electromechanical Morcellation Reported in the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) Database.,"May, 2015","STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate adverse events associated with electromechanical morcellation as reported to the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of an established database (Canadian Task Force classification III). INTERVENTION: A search of the MAUDE database for terms associated with commercially available electromechanical morcellation devices was undertaken for events leading to injury or death between 2004 and 2014. Data, including the types of injury, need for conversion to open surgery, type of open surgery, and clinical outcomes, were extracted from the records. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Over a 10-year period, 9 events associated with death and 215 events associated with patient injury or significant delay of the surgical procedure were recorded. These involved 137 device failures, 51 organ injuries, and the morcellation of 27 previously undiagnosed malignancies. Of the 9 deaths, 1 was associated with organ injury, and the other 8 were associated with morcellation of cancer. Of the 27 undiagnosed cancers, 5 were reported by the manufacturer, 8 were reported by the patient or family, 9 were reported by medical or news reports, 2 were reported by medical professionals, and 3 were due to litigation. Morcellation of an undiagnosed malignancy was first reported to the database in December 2013. CONCLUSIONS: The MAUDE database appears to detect perioperative events, such as device failures and organ injury at the time of surgery, but appears to be poor at detecting late events after surgery, such as the potential spread of cancer.

Furthermore, it evaluates as to which manipulator best suits which surgical procedure. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, COCHRANE, CINAHL, Academic Search Premier, Science Direct and the MAUDE database were searched. Technical information was retrieved from the manufacturers. RESULTS: 25 articles covering 10 uterine manipulators were found. Studies regarding implementation and use of manipulators are scarce; only two surveys were found comparing different manipulators. Moreover, clinical evidence proving the efficacy of manipulators with respect to prevention of complications, inherent to laparoscopic surgery, does not exist. CONCLUSION: The use of uterine manipulators is well established and it is clear that uterine manipulators offer the easiest way to handle the uterus during surgery. However, detailed information regarding efficacy and safety is scarce. Clinical evidence substantiating the assumed mechanism of prevention of ureter injuries was not found.

25938303,Safety and Procedural Success of Left Atrial Appendage Exclusion With the Lariat Device: A Systematic Review of Published Reports and Analytic Review of the FDA MAUDE Database.,"May, 2015","IMPORTANCE: The Lariat device has received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) clearance for soft-tissue approximation and is being widely used off-label for left atrial appendage (LAA) exclusion. A comprehensive analysis of safety and effectiveness has not been reported. OBJECTIVES: To perform a systematic review of published literature to assess safety and procedural success, defined as successful closure of the LAA during the index procedure, of the Lariat device. We performed a formal analytic review of the FDA MAUDE (Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience) database to compile adverse event reports from real-world practice with the Lariat. DATA SOURCES: For the systematic review, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library were searched from January 2007 through August 2014 to identify all studies reporting use of the Lariat device in 3 or more patients. The FDA MAUDE database was queried for adverse events reports related to Lariat use. DATA EXTRACTIONS AND SYNTHESIS: Data were abstracted in duplicate by 2 physician reviewers. Events from published literature were pooled using a generic inverse variance weighting with a random effects model. Cumulative and individual adverse events were also reported using the FDA MAUDE data set. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Procedural adverse events and procedural success. RESULTS: In the systematic review, 5 reports of Lariat device use in 309 participants were identified. Specific complications weighted for inverse of variance of individual studies were urgent need for cardiac surgery (2.3%; 7 of 309 procedures) and death (0.3%; 1 of 309 procedures). Procedural success was 90.3% (279 of 309 procedures). In the FDA MAUDE database, there were 35 unique reports of adverse events with use of the Lariat device. Among these, we identified 5 adverse event reports that noted pericardial effusion and death and an additional 23 reported urgent cardiac surgery without mention of death.

The aim of this study was to present the real-world experiences of Solitaire-FR-related adverse events by reviewing the MAUDE (Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience) as published on the United States Food and Drug Administration website. In total, 85 adverse events related to the use of the Solitaire FR stent were reported between March 2012 and October 2014. In 80 patients these adverse events were attributable to inadvertent detachment of the device. Thirteen of these 80 patients (16%) died after the procedure. Morbidity data were available in 62 patients, among whom 11 (18%) had suffered a procedure-related injury. Detachment occurred at the first, second, and third pass in nine (21%), 21 (49%), and 13 (30%) of the 43 patients for whom this information was available, respectively. Resistance was perceived by the physician during retrieval of the device in 12 patients, and lesion characteristics were noted in 13. A rescue maneuver was reported in 20 (25%) of the 80 patients in whom the adverse event was attributable to detachment of the device, resulting in flow reestablishment in 13 (65%).

25763759,Locked Deflection During Flexible Ureteroscopy: Incidence and Elucidation of the Mechanism of an Underreported Complication.,"Mar, 2015","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Flexible ureteroscopy (URS) is widely implemented with a well-defined safety profile and low complication rates. Although rare, locked deflection of a flexible ureteroscope in the upper tract is a potentially serious complication with poorly understood etiology and is likely underreported. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We attempted to capture all cases of locked deflection during URS by performing an anonymous, online computer survey targeting members of the Endourological Society. The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database and published literature were queried to find additional cases. The indication for URS, method of ureteroscope removal, patient outcomes, incident reporting, and explanations provided by the manufacturer or third party repair service were obtained whenever possible. RESULTS: In total, 10 cases of locked deflection during flexible URS were identified. Survey responses were obtained from 250/2424 (10.3%) endourologists polled. Locked deflection was noted by 8/250 (3.2%). The reported literature and MAUDE database identified one case each. Successful removal was noted in four using retrograde manipulation techniques while a percutaneous approach was used in three patients. Open surgery was needed in two cases because of resultant ureteral avulsion, and in one case, an open ureterotomy was needed for ureteroscope extraction. According to our survey, locked deflection was reported to the patient in 4/8 cases, the hospital in 3/8 cases, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 0/8 cases. The two cases reported outside of our survey both notified the FDA. The minority of respondents (2/8), including our group, felt improper surgical technique was responsible for resultant locked deflection. Specifically, removal of a completely deflected ureteroscope through a stenotic infundibulum should be avoided. Rather, in such a situation, the ureteroscope should be straightened under fluoroscopy before being withdrawn. CONCLUSIONS: Locked deflection of a flexible ureteroscope is rare and underreported. Some cases are attributed to surgical technique, and awareness is crucial for avoidance of this complication.",No Full Text Available,locked deflection during flexible ureteroscopy incidence and elucidation of the mechanism of an underreported complication,background and purpose flexible ureteroscopy urs is widely implemented with a welldefined safety profile and low complication rates although rare locked deflection of a flexible ureteroscope in the upper tract is a potentially serious complication with poorly understood etiology and is likely underreported materials and methods we attempted to capture all cases of locked deflection during urs by performing an anonymous online computer survey targeting members of the endourological society the manufacturer and user facility device experience maude database and published literature were queried to find additional cases the indication for urs method of ureteroscope removal patient outcomes incident reporting and explanations provided by the manufacturer or third party repair service were obtained whenever possible results in total  cases of locked deflection during flexible urs were identified survey responses were obtained from   endourologists polled locked deflection was noted by   the reported literature and maude database identified one case each successful removal was noted in four using retrograde manipulation techniques while a percutaneous approach was used in three patients open surgery was needed in two cases because of resultant ureteral avulsion and in one case an open ureterotomy was needed for ureteroscope extraction according to our survey locked deflection was reported to the patient in  cases the hospital in  cases and the food and drug administration fda  cases the two cases reported outside of our survey both notified the fda the minority of respondents  including our group felt improper surgical technique was responsible for resultant locked deflection specifically removal of a completely deflected ureteroscope through a stenotic infundibulum should be avoided rather in such a situation the ureteroscope should be straightened under fluoroscopy before being withdrawn conclusions locked deflection of a flexible ureteroscope is rare and underreported some cases are attributed to surgical technique and awareness is crucial for avoidance of this complication,locked deflection flexible ureteroscopy incidence elucidation mechanism underreported complication background purpose flexible ureteroscopy ur widely implemented welldefined safety profile low complication rate although rare locked deflection flexible ureteroscope upper tract potentially serious complication poorly understood etiology likely underreported material method attempted capture case locked deflection ur performing anonymous online computer survey targeting member endourological society manufacturer user facility device experience maude database published literature queried find additional case indication ur method ureteroscope removal patient outcome incident reporting explanation provided manufacturer third party repair service obtained whenever possible result total case locked deflection flexible ur identified survey response obtained endourologists polled locked deflection noted reported literature maude database identified one case successful removal noted four using retrograde manipulation technique percutaneous approach used three patient open surgery needed two case resultant ureteral avulsion one case open ureterotomy needed ureteroscope extraction according survey locked deflection reported patient case hospital case food drug administration fda case two case reported outside survey notified fda minority respondent including group felt improper surgical technique responsible resultant locked deflection specifically removal completely deflected ureteroscope stenotic infundibulum avoided rather situation ureteroscope straightened fluoroscopy withdrawn conclusion locked deflection flexible ureteroscope rare underreported case attributed surgical technique awareness crucial avoidance complication,Uncertain
25784563,"Insulin pump risks and benefits: a clinical appraisal of pump safety standards, adverse event reporting and research needs. A joint statement of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes and the American Diabetes Association Diabetes Technology Working Group.","Mar, 2015","Insulin pump therapy, also known as continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), is an important and evolving form of insulin delivery, which is mainly used for people with type 1 diabetes. However, even with modern insulin pumps, errors of insulin infusion can occur due to pump failure, insulin infusion set (IIS) blockage, infusion site problems, insulin stability issues, user error or a combination of these. Users are therefore exposed to significant and potentially fatal hazards: interruption of insulin infusion can result in hyperglycaemia and ketoacidosis; conversely, delivery of excessive insulin can cause severe hypoglycaemia. Nevertheless, the available evidence on the safety and efficacy of CSII remains limited. The European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) and American Diabetes Association (ADA) have therefore joined forces to review the systems in place for evaluating the safety of pumps from a clinical perspective. We found that useful information held by the manufacturing companies is not currently shared in a sufficiently transparent manner. Public availability of adverse event (AE) reports on the US Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database is potentially a rich source of safety information but is insufficiently utilised due to the current configuration of the system; the comparable database in Europe (European Databank on Medical Devices, EUDAMED) is not publicly accessible. Many AEs appear to be attributable to human factors and/or user error, but the extent to which manufacturing companies are required by regulators to consider the interactions of users with the technical features of their products is limited. The clinical studies required by regulators prior to marketing are small and over-reliant on bench testing in relation to 'predicate' products. Once a pump is available on the market, insufficient data are made publicly available on its long-term use in a real-world setting; such data could provide vital information to help healthcare teams to educate and support users, and thereby prevent AEs. As well as requiring more from the manufacturing companies, we call for public funding of more research addressing clinically important questions in relation to pump therapy: both observational studies and clinical trials. At present there are significant differences in the regulatory systems between the USA and European Union at both pre- and post-marketing stages; improvements in the European system are more urgently required.

Many AEs appear to be attributable to human factors and/or user error, but the extent to which manufacturing companies are required by regulators to consider the interactions of users with the technical features of their products is limited. The clinical studies required by regulators prior to marketing are small and over-reliant on bench testing in relation to ""predicate"" products. Once a pump is available on the market, insufficient data are made publicly available on its long-term use in a real-world setting; such data could provide vital information to help health care teams to educate and support users and thereby prevent AEs. As well as requiring more from the manufacturing companies, we call for public funding of more research addressing clinically important questions in relation to pump therapy: both observational studies and clinical trials.

25637208,The dangers of dental devices as reported in the Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database.,"Feb, 2015","BACKGROUND: The authors conducted a study to determine the frequency and type of adverse events (AEs) associated with dental devices reported to the Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. METHODS: The authors downloaded and reviewed the dental device-related AEs reported to MAUDE from January 1, 1996, through December 31,2011. RESULTS: MAUDE received a total of 1,978,056 reports between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 2011. Among these reports, 28,046 (1.4%) AE reports were associated with dental devices. Within the dental AE reports that had event type information, 17,261 reported injuries, 7,777 reported device malfunctions, and 66 reported deaths. Among the 66 entries classified as death reports, 52 reported a death in the description; the remaining were either misclassified or lacked sufficient information in the report to determine whether a death had occurred. Of the dental device-associated AEs, 53.5% pertained to endosseous implants. CONCLUSIONS: A plethora of devices are used in dental care. To achieve Element 1 of Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's Patient Safety Initiative, clinicians and researchers must be able to monitor the safety of dental devices. Although MAUDE was identified by the authors as essentially the sole source of this valuable information on adverse events, their investigations led them to conclude that MAUDE had substantial limitations that prevent it from being the broad-based patient safety sentinel the profession requires.

25655709,"FDA MAUDE data on complications with lasers, light sources, and energy-based devices.","Feb, 2015","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: It is essential for physicians to be fully informed regarding adverse events and malfunctions associated with medical devices that occur in routine practice. There is limited information on this important issue in the medical literature, and it is mostly based on initial studies and case reports. More advanced knowledge regarding device adverse events is necessary to guide physicians towards providing safe treatments. The FDA requires that manufacturers and device users submit medical device reports (MDRs) for suspected injuries from device use or malfunction. The database of MDRs, entitled Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) enables the FDA to monitor device performance and identify potential safety issues. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: We employed the following search strategy to identify reported adverse events. We searched the MAUDE electronic database on the FDA website in December 2013: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfmaude/search.cfm We collected all reported cases between 1991 and December 2013. The search terms utilized included a comprehensive list of device manufacturers, specific product names, and the wavelengths/technology of the devices used in the field of dermatology. RESULTS: Our search yielded 1257 MDRs. Forty-five MDRs were excluded due to insufficient data. The data is broken down into the adverse events observed, such as, but not limited to: blistering, burns, scarring, dyschromia, fat loss, and nerve palsy. The MDRs describe the adverse event and attempt to determine if it was related to device malfunction versus operator error. Radiofrequency devices, diode lasers, and intense pulsed light devices were the most commonly reported devices related to injuries. CONCLUSION: 1257 MDRs, from a myriad of devices used in dermatology, have been reported to the FDA as of December 2013. Despite the underreporting of adverse events, the MAUDE database is an untapped resource of post-market surveillance of medical devices. The database can offer additional information, which combined with the initial device studies and published case reports from our colleagues, will help raise awareness and improve patient safety.",No Full Text Available,fda maude data on complications with lasers light sources and energybased devices,background and objective it is essential for physicians to be fully informed regarding adverse events and malfunctions associated with medical devices that occur in routine practice there is limited information on this important issue in the medical literature and it is mostly based on initial studies and case reports more advanced knowledge regarding device adverse events is necessary to guide physicians towards providing safe treatments the fda requires that manufacturers and device users submit medical device reports mdrs for suspected injuries from device use or malfunction the database of mdrs entitled manufacturer and user facility device experience maude enables the fda to monitor device performance and identify potential safety issues study designmaterials and methods we employed the following search strategy to identify reported adverse events we searched the maude electronic database on the fda website in december  httpwwwaccessdatafdagovscriptscdrhcfdocscfmaudesearchcfm we collected all reported cases between  and december  the search terms utilized included a comprehensive list of device manufacturers specific product names and the wavelengthstechnology of the devices used in the field of dermatology results our search yielded  mdrs fortyfive mdrs were excluded due to insufficient data the data is broken down into the adverse events observed such as but not limited to blistering burns scarring dyschromia fat loss and nerve palsy the mdrs describe the adverse event and attempt to determine if it was related to device malfunction versus operator error radiofrequency devices diode lasers and intense pulsed light devices were the most commonly reported devices related to injuries conclusion  mdrs from a myriad of devices used in dermatology have been reported to the fda as of december  despite the underreporting of adverse events the maude database is an untapped resource of postmarket surveillance of medical devices the database can offer additional information which combined with the initial device studies and published case reports from our colleagues will help raise awareness and improve patient safety,fda maude data complication laser light source energybased device background objective essential physician fully informed regarding adverse event malfunction associated medical device occur routine practice limited information important issue medical literature mostly based initial study case report advanced knowledge regarding device adverse event necessary guide physician towards providing safe treatment fda requires manufacturer device user submit medical device report mdrs suspected injury device use malfunction database mdrs entitled manufacturer user facility device experience maude enables fda monitor device performance identify potential safety issue study designmaterials method employed following search strategy identify reported adverse event searched maude electronic database fda website december httpwwwaccessdatafdagovscriptscdrhcfdocscfmaudesearchcfm collected reported case december search term utilized included comprehensive list device manufacturer specific product name wavelengthstechnology device used field dermatology result search yielded mdrs fortyfive mdrs excluded due insufficient data data broken adverse event observed limited blistering burn scarring dyschromia fat loss nerve palsy mdrs describe adverse event attempt determine related device malfunction versus operator error radiofrequency device diode laser intense pulsed light device commonly reported device related injury conclusion mdrs myriad device used dermatology reported fda december despite underreporting adverse event maude database untapped resource postmarket surveillance medical device database offer additional information combined initial device study published case report colleague help raise awareness improve patient safety,Laser-Assisted Dermal Filler Complications
25673309,Morbidity and mortality after thermal venous ablations.,"Feb, 2015","BACKGROUND: The treatment of saphenous vein reflux has evolved over the years with the development of thermal ablation techniques. This study was designed to analyze the complications of endovenous ablation (EVA) using data from an open, voluntary national database. METHODS: We analyzed 349 adverse events of endovenous laser (EVLT) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) reported in the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database from January 2000 to June 2012. Outcomes of interest were pulmonary embolism (PE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), death, and device failures (i.e. broken laser tip, broken sheath). RESULTS: Two hundred and three (58%) reports were patient-related injuries and the other 146 (42%) device-related failures. More complications were related to RFA compared to EVLT (216 vs. 133 procedures). Thirty (8%) non-fatal PEs and 123 (35%) DVTs were described. There were 7 (2%) periprocedural deaths, all from PE. Of the 135 device failure reports, 41(30%) required surgical intervention. Despite an increasing number of procedures, reported events peaked around 2008 and stabilized since then. Over the past 5 years, the incidence of adverse events reported for EVLT and RFA were 1 and 2 per 10,000 procedures. The complication ratio over the years was <1:2500 for DVT, <1:10,000 for PE, <1:50,000 for death. CONCLUSION: EVA has gained high acceptance worldwide but the risks tend to be overlooked. Despite a very low complication rate, mortality has been reported. The complications found in MAUDE represent only a fraction as the majority of the practitioners are not aware of this database.

25301369,Pseudoaneurysm formation after medtronic freestyle porcine aortic bioprosthesis implantation: a word of caution.,"Oct, 2014","BACKGROUND: A growing literature describes aneurysmal deterioration after implantation of the stentless porcine aortic Medtronic Freestyle bioprosthesis (MFB; Medtronic Inc, Minneapolis, MN), with some suggesting inadequate tissue fixation with immune response as a cause. However, disjointed reports make the significance of these findings difficult to interpret. We address this concern by aggregating available data. METHODS: We reviewed institutional data, the Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience registry, and the medical literature for mention of aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm after MFB. Case details were aggregated, and the rate of aneurysmal deterioration was estimated. Immunohistopathologic examination of institutional explanted specimens was performed to elucidate a cause. RESULTS: We found 42 cases of aneurysmal deterioration with adequate detail for analysis; all occurred with full root replacement and valve sizes ranging from 23 to 29 mm. The rate of aneurysmal deterioration considering all data sources was 1.1% (9 of 851; 95% confidence interval, 0.5% to 2.0%) vs 4.7% (4 of 86; 95% confidence interval, 1.3% to 11.5%) at our institution, where yearly surveillance imaging is performed. Rate of aneurysmal deterioration appeared constant until 5 years after the operation; however, events are reported out to 10 years. Consistent with previous reports, histopathology demonstrated an immune cell infiltrate in areas of MFB wall breakdown. CONCLUSIONS: Aneurysmal deterioration is an increasingly described complication of MFB implantation as a full root, with an incidence as high as 4.7%. Given the observed immune reaction and lack of occurrence in smaller (19-mm and 21-mm) valve sizes, inadequate pressure fixation of larger valves is a potential etiology. Patients with MFB require annual surveillance imaging, and consideration of this complication should factor into preoperative decision making because treatment mandates redo root replacement, which may not be feasible in high-risk patients.",No Full Text Available,pseudoaneurysm formation after medtronic freestyle porcine aortic bioprosthesis implantation a word of caution,background a growing literature describes aneurysmal deterioration after implantation of the stentless porcine aortic medtronic freestyle bioprosthesis mfb medtronic inc minneapolis mn with some suggesting inadequate tissue fixation with immune response as a cause however disjointed reports make the significance of these findings difficult to interpret we address this concern by aggregating available data methods we reviewed institutional data the food and drug administrations manufacturer and user facility device experience registry and the medical literature for mention of aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm after mfb case details were aggregated and the rate of aneurysmal deterioration was estimated immunohistopathologic examination of institutional explanted specimens was performed to elucidate a cause results we found  cases of aneurysmal deterioration with adequate detail for analysis all occurred with full root replacement and valve sizes ranging from  to  mm the rate of aneurysmal deterioration considering all data sources was   of   confidence interval  to  vs   of   confidence interval  to  at our institution where yearly surveillance imaging is performed rate of aneurysmal deterioration appeared constant until  years after the operation however events are reported out to  years consistent with previous reports histopathology demonstrated an immune cell infiltrate in areas of mfb wall breakdown conclusions aneurysmal deterioration is an increasingly described complication of mfb implantation as a full root with an incidence as high as  given the observed immune reaction and lack of occurrence in smaller mm and mm valve sizes inadequate pressure fixation of larger valves is a potential etiology patients with mfb require annual surveillance imaging and consideration of this complication should factor into preoperative decision making because treatment mandates redo root replacement which may not be feasible in highrisk patients,pseudoaneurysm formation medtronic freestyle porcine aortic bioprosthesis implantation word caution background growing literature describes aneurysmal deterioration implantation stentless porcine aortic medtronic freestyle bioprosthesis mfb medtronic inc minneapolis mn suggesting inadequate tissue fixation immune response cause however disjointed report make significance finding difficult interpret address concern aggregating available data method reviewed institutional data food drug administration manufacturer user facility device experience registry medical literature mention aneurysm pseudoaneurysm mfb case detail aggregated rate aneurysmal deterioration estimated immunohistopathologic examination institutional explanted specimen performed elucidate cause result found case aneurysmal deterioration adequate detail analysis occurred full root replacement valve size ranging mm rate aneurysmal deterioration considering data source confidence interval v confidence interval institution yearly surveillance imaging performed rate aneurysmal deterioration appeared constant year operation however event reported year consistent previous report histopathology demonstrated immune cell infiltrate area mfb wall breakdown conclusion aneurysmal deterioration increasingly described complication mfb implantation full root incidence high given observed immune reaction lack occurrence smaller mm mm valve size inadequate pressure fixation larger valve potential etiology patient mfb require annual surveillance imaging consideration complication factor preoperative decision making treatment mandate redo root replacement may feasible highrisk patient,Uncertain
25324917,"Risk of transmission of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and related ""superbugs"" during gastrointestinal endoscopy.","Oct, 2014","To evaluate the risk of transmission of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and their related superbugs during gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. Reports of outbreaks linked to GI endoscopes contaminated with different types of infectious agents, including CRE and their related superbugs, were reviewed. Published during the past 30 years, both prior to and since CRE's emergence, these reports were obtained by searching the peer-reviewed medical literature (via the United States National Library of Medicine's ""MEDLINE"" database); the Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database, or ""MAUDE""; and the Internet (via Google's search engine). This review focused on an outbreak of CRE in 2013 following the GI endoscopic procedure known as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, or ERCP, performed at ""Hospital X"" located in the suburbs of Chicago (IL; United States). Part of the largest outbreak of CRE in United States history, the infection and colonization of 10 and 28 of this hospital's patients, respectively, received considerable media attention and was also investigated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which published a report about this outbreak in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), in 2014. This report, along with the results of an independent inspection of Hospital X's infection control practices following this CRE outbreak, were also reviewed. While this article focuses primarily on the prevention of transmissions of CRE and their related superbugs in the GI endoscopic setting, some of its discussion and recommendations may also apply to other healthcare settings, to other types of flexible endoscopes, and to other types of transmissible infectious agents. This review found that GI endoscopy is an important risk factor for the transmission of CRE and their related superbugs, having been recently associated with patient morbidity and mortality following ERCP. The CDC reported in MMWR that the type of GI endoscope, known as an ERCP endoscope, that Hospital X used to perform ERCP in 2013 on the 38 patients who became infected or colonized with CRE might be particularly challenging to clean and disinfect, because of the complexity of its physical design. If performed in strict accordance with the endoscope manufacturer's labeling, supplemented as needed with professional organizations' published guidelines, however, current practices for reprocessing GI endoscopes, which include high-level disinfection, are reportedly adequate for the prevention of transmission of CRE and their related superbugs. Several recommendations are provided to prevent CRE transmissions in the healthcare setting. CRE transmissions are not limited to contaminated GI endoscopes and also have been linked to other reusable flexible endoscopic instrumentation, including bronchoscopes and cystoscopes. In conclusion, contaminated GI endoscopes, particularly those used during ERCP, have been causally linked to outbreaks of CRE and their related superbugs, with associated patient morbidity and mortality. Thorough reprocessing of these complex reusable instruments is necessary to prevent disease transmission and ensure patient safety during GI endoscopy. Enhanced training and monitoring of reprocessing staffers to verify the proper cleaning and brushing of GI endoscopes, especially the area around, behind and near the forceps elevator located at the distal end of the ERCP endoscope, are recommended. If the ERCP endoscope features a narrow and exposed channel that houses a wire connecting the GI endoscope's control head to this forceps elevator, then this channel's complete reprocessing, including its flushing with a detergent using a procedure validated for effectiveness, is also emphasized.",No Full Text Available,risk of transmission of carbapenemresistant enterobacteriaceae and related

Major events included intubation/admission to an intensive care unit (n = 14), bowel damage (n = 12), hysterectomy (n = 6), and death (n = 2). Minor events included uterine perforation requiring no other treatment (n = 29), device failure (n = 25), uncomplicated fluid overload (n = 19), postoperative bleeding controlled using noninvasive measures (n = 6), and pelvic infection (n = 4). These events were then categorized according to manufacturer. The number of adverse events reported to the MAUDE database was divided by the total units sold as a surrogate for the estimated number of procedures performed. Understanding the limitation of the numbers used as a numerator and denominator, we concluded that adverse events complicated hysteroscopic morcellation in <0.1% cases. CONCLUSIONS: The suction-based, mechanical energy, rotating tubular cutting system was developed to overcome adverse events that occur during traditional resectoscopy. On the basis of acknowledged limited information from the MAUDE database, it seems that life-threatening complications such as fluid overload, uterine perforation, and bleeding do occur with hysteroscopic morcellation but less frequently than with traditional electrocautery.",No Full Text Available,hysteroscopic morcellation review of the manufacturer and user facility device experience maude database,study objective to investigate the number and type of adverse events associated with hysteroscopic morcellation of intrauterine disease design systematic review of manufacturer and user device experience maude database from  to june  canadian task force classification iii setting na patients women undergoing hysteroscopic surgery for removal of intrauterine polyps or myomas with use of a reciprocating morcellator interventions the maude database was searched for the key words hysteroscope hysteroscopic reciprocating morcellator interlace myosure smith  nephew and truclear to identify reported incidences of device malfunction injury or death a total of  adverse events were analyzed reports were reviewed individually and categorized by date of occurrence type of morcellation device type of complication and a brief description each company was contacted to provide an estimate of the number of procedures performed or units sold to date measurements and main results from  to june   adverse events were reported to the maude database on the basis of severity adverse events were categorized as major or minor complications major events included intubationadmission to an intensive care unit n   bowel damage n   hysterectomy n   and death n   minor events included uterine perforation requiring no other treatment n   device failure n   uncomplicated fluid overload n   postoperative bleeding controlled using noninvasive measures n   and pelvic infection n   these events were then categorized according to manufacturer the number of adverse events reported to the maude database was divided by the total units sold as a surrogate for the estimated number of procedures performed understanding the limitation of the numbers used as a numerator and denominator we concluded that adverse events complicated hysteroscopic morcellation in  cases conclusions the suctionbased mechanical energy rotating tubular cutting system was developed to overcome adverse events that occur during traditional resectoscopy on the basis of acknowledged limited information from the maude database it seems that lifethreatening complications such as fluid overload uterine perforation and bleeding do occur with hysteroscopic morcellation but less frequently than with traditional electrocautery,hysteroscopic morcellation review manufacturer user facility device experience maude database study objective investigate number type adverse event associated hysteroscopic morcellation intrauterine disease design systematic review manufacturer user device experience maude database june canadian task force classification iii setting na patient woman undergoing hysteroscopic surgery removal intrauterine polyp myoma use reciprocating morcellator intervention maude database searched key word hysteroscope hysteroscopic reciprocating morcellator interlace myosure smith nephew truclear identify reported incidence device malfunction injury death total adverse event analyzed report reviewed individually categorized date occurrence type morcellation device type complication brief description company contacted provide estimate number procedure performed unit sold date measurement main result june adverse event reported maude database basis severity adverse event categorized major minor complication major event included intubationadmission intensive care unit n bowel damage n hysterectomy n death n minor event included uterine perforation requiring treatment n device failure n uncomplicated fluid overload n postoperative bleeding controlled using noninvasive measure n pelvic infection n event categorized according manufacturer number adverse event reported maude database divided total unit sold surrogate estimated number procedure performed understanding limitation number used numerator denominator concluded adverse event complicated hysteroscopic morcellation case conclusion suctionbased mechanical energy rotating tubular cutting system developed overcome adverse event occur traditional resectoscopy basis acknowledged limited information maude database seems lifethreatening complication fluid overload uterine perforation bleeding occur hysteroscopic morcellation le frequently traditional electrocautery,Hysteroscopic Morcellation Complications

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe the prevalence of a novel mechanism of battery failure in St. Jude Medical Fortify and Unify ICDs. METHODS: Cases of premature Fortify battery failure from a single center are reported. A search (January 1, 2010 through November 30, 2013) for Fortify and Unify premature batter failure was conducted of the Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database (MAUDE). These findings were supplemented with information provided by St. Jude Medical. RESULTS: Premature battery failure for 2 Fortify ICDs in our practice were attributed to the presence of lithium clusters near the cathode, causing a short circuit and high current drain. The prevalence of this mechanism of premature battery failure was 0.6% in our practice. A MAUDE search identified 39 cases of Fortify (30) and Unify (9) premature battery depletion confirmed by the manufacturer, representing a 0.03% prevalence. Four additional Fortify and 2 Unify cases were identified in MAUDE as suspected premature battery depletion, but in these cases the pulse generator was not returned to the manufacturer for evaluation. St. Jude Medical identified 10 cases of premature battery failure due to lithium clusters in Fortify devices (9) and Unify devices (1), representing a 0.004% prevalence.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MAUDE database was reviewed from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2012. Product class search criteria were ""filter, intravascular, cardiovascular."" Type of device used and specific adverse events (AEs) were recorded. RESULTS: For the period January 2009-December 2012, 1,606 reported AEs involving 1,057 IVC filters were identified in the MAUDE database . Of reported AEs, 1,394 (86.8%) involved retrievable inferior vena cava filters (rIVCFs), and 212 (13.2%) involved permanent inferior vena cava filters (pIVCFs) (P < .0001). Reported AEs included fracture, migration, limb embolization, tilt, IVC penetration, venous thromboembolism and pulmonary embolism, IVC thrombus, and malfunctions during placement. Each specific AE was reported with significantly higher frequency in rIVCFs compared with pIVCFs. The most common reported complication with rIVCFs was fracture, whereas the most commonly reported complications with pIVCFs were placement malfunctions. For rIVCFs, the most commonly reported AE varied depending on filter brand.

24923962,Over-the-counter (OTC) bruxism splints available on the Internet.,"Jun, 2014","BACKGROUND: Some individuals may now be bypassing their dentists for treatment of bruxism. Self-diagnosed, self-adjusted and self-monitored consumers can access over-the-counter (OTC) bruxism splints via the Internet. While some may regard this market as benefiting consumers there are potential pitfalls that need to be highlighted. These include unevidenced claims of efficacy. OBJECTIVE: To survey OTC bruxism splints available to individuals in the UK via the Internet, categorise their characteristics, and determine any web-based claims or safety warnings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An Internet search was made of OTC bruxism splints available in the UK. The following information was recorded for each OTC splint: the name of the manufacturer, name of the device, its UK price and any claims and safety warnings made either on a major UK retail website or via other UK web retail outlets. In addition, a note was made of any web-based mention of 'CE marking', indicating compliance with the EC Medical Devices Directive's requirements for safety, quality and performance. RESULTS: Safety information is notable for its paucity and is totally lacking on many Internet sites. However, manufacturers are not obliged to display safety information on the Internet, but it must be provided with the product. A search of the MAUDE database showed a number of potentially serious adverse events associated with these splints including choking hazards, tissue damage and occlusal changes. None of the splint designs assure full occlusal coverage. CONCLUSIONS: As with any partial coverage appliance, if worn for protracted periods there may be a risk of unwanted tooth movement.

24786813,Effectiveness of an electromagnetic feeding tube placement device in detecting inadvertent respiratory placement.,"May, 2014","BACKGROUND: Use of technology capable of electromagnetically tracking advancement of a feeding tube on a monitoring screen during insertion may enable detection of deviation of the tube from the midline as it advances through the chest, possibly indicating entry of the tube into the right or left main bronchus. PURPOSES: To describe (1) published peer-reviewed studies that report on the detection of malpositioned tubes inserted by an electromagnetic tube placement device, and (2) events reported to the US Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database regarding use of such a device. METHODS: An Ovid MEDLINE search was conducted to locate peer-reviewed studies published between 2007 and 2012 that referred to use of an electromagnetic tube placement device to detect inadvertent respiratory placements of feeding tubes. In addition, an online search of the MAUDE database was conducted for the years 2007 through 2012. RESULTS: The Ovid MEDLINE search yielded 6 studies that referred to respiratory placements; no cases of pneumothorax were reported. The MAUDE database search yielded 21 adverse events associated with use of an electromagnetic tube placement device (including 17 cases of pneumothorax and 2 deaths). As the MAUDE database relies on voluntary reports, this number should not be construed as the incidence of malpositioned tubes during this period.

24635137,Disruption of silicone valve housing in a Codman Hakim Precision valve with integrated Siphonguard.,"Mar, 2014","Authors of this report describe 2 patients who had undergone shunt insertion for hydrocephalus and who, at 6 weeks or 9 months after their last revision, presented with symptoms of shunt dysfunction and CSF collections at the valve site. At the ensuing shunt revision in both patients, the silicone housing was fractured and the Siphonguard was disconnected from the Codman Hakim Precision flat-bottom valve. The cause of these failures was not clear since manipulation, bending, and twisting of the valves were not thought to have occurred during implantation. A review of the FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database revealed 58 cases of silicone housing failure in the Codman Hakim Precision valve with integrated Siphonguard since the year 2000. A single report was found in the databases administered by the Canadian Medical Devices Sentinel Network (CMDSNet). The Codman Hakim Precision valves with integrated Siphonguard are delicate devices that do not withstand the intraoperative handling tolerated by other valves. When these valves are implanted, gentle handling and wide exposures are needed to minimize the risk of valve damage. Valves should be handled according to the manufacturer's instructions. However, in light of this particular pattern of failure, it is recommended that the manufacturer redesign this valve to provide handling tolerance that is characteristic of other valves on the market.

DESIGN: Database search (Canadian Task Force classification III). INTERVENTION: A search of the FDA MAUDE database was performed by brand name ""da Vinci"" and manufacturer ""Intuitive Surgical."" Reports reflecting gynecologic procedures either by description or procedure name were included. A record of reports was kept to ensure that no duplicates were added. The date and type of event (operator-related error, technical system failure, or surgical injuries attributed to use of the robot) and the clinical outcome were recorded. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-six percent of reported events (n = 73) resulted in injury, and 8.5% (n = 24) resulted in death. Of note, although adnexal procedures were performed in <3% of the cohort, they accounted for 20% of the fatalities. Twenty-one percent of injuries were attributed to operator-related error, and 14% to technical system failure; 65% were not directly related to use of the robot. Fifteen deaths were reported during planned hysterectomy. Four of those were due to injury to a major blood vessel (iliac artery in 3, and aorta in 1), although a detailed description of how the injury occurred was absent from the event description.

DESIGN: Literature review. INTERVENTION: The PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and MAUDE databases were systematically searched for all available literature using the terms ""morcellator,"" ""morcellators,"" ""morcellate,"" ""morcellation,"" and ""morcellated."" All articles with information on morcellation time and morcellated tissue mass or the calculated morcellation rate of electromechanical morcellators used for gynecologic laparoscopic surgery were included. For general data of an existing morcellator, the manufacturer was contacted and Google was searched. Data for morcellation rate, type of procedure, and general characteristics were compared. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Seven articles were suitable for analysis, and 11 different morcellators were found. In the past decades the morcellation rate has increased. The described morcellation rate ranged from 6.2 to 40.4 g/min. Motor peeling is currently the fastest working principle. Comparing hysterectomy and myomectomy per device, the Morcellex and Rotocut morcellators demonstrated a higher morcellation rate for myomectomy, 25.9 vs 30 g/min and 28.4 vs 33.1 g/min, respectively, although the X-Tract morcellator showed a higher rate for hysterectomy, 14.2 vs 11.7 g/min. CONCLUSION: Over the years, the morcellator has improved with respect to the morcellation rate. However, the morcellation process still has limitations, including tissue scattering, morcellator-related injuries, and the inevitable small blade diameter, which all come at the expense of the morcellation rate and time.

24439579,"Increased risk of cardiovascular perforation during ECMO with a bicaval, wire-reinforced cannula.","Jan, 2014","PURPOSE: Cardiac or major vascular perforation is a rare but serious risk of ECMO. We sought to determine if perforation rates are related to cannula design. METHODS: We utilized three methods to evaluate perforation on ECMO. 1. The ELSO registry was queried to establish the historical rate of hemorrhagic pericardial tamponade. 2. ELSO centers were surveyed regarding cannula related perforation events and brands of cannulas used over a four year time period (January 2008-March 2012). 3. The FDA's MAUDE database was reviewed looking for adverse events related to ECMO cannulas. RESULTS: The historical rate of hemorrhagic pericardial tamponade in the ELSO registry was 0.53% (~1985-2010, ELSO registry). In the survey there were eleven reports of cannula-related perforation, 0.74% (11/1482 p-value=0.29) at 7 different ELSO centers with 23 ELSO centers responding (17% response rate). The incidence of perforation was much higher for the wire-reinforced bicaval design 3.6% (10/279) as compared to catheters designed for the atrial position, 0.1% (1/1203, p-value<0.0001). Review of the FDA's MAUDE database revealed 19 adverse events related to the bicaval cannula design, 16 of which were hemorrhagic pericardial effusions or tamponade. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest a relatively high rate of cardiac perforation associated with the dual lumen bicaval cannula.

24333632,Laparoscopic morcellator-related complications.,"Dec, 2013","Morcellation at laparoscopy is a commonly used minimally invasive method to extract bulky tissue from the abdomen without extending abdominal incisions. Despite widespread use of morcellation, complications still remain underreported and poorly understood. We performed a systematic review of surgical centers in the United States to identify, collate and update the morcellator-related injuries and near misses associated with powered tissue removal. We searched articles on morcellator-related injuries published from 1993 through June 2013. In addition, all cases reported to MedSun and the FDA device database (MAUDE) were evaluated for inclusion. We used the search terms ""morcellation,"" ""morcellator,"" ""parasitic,"" and ""retained"" and model name keywords ""Morcellex,"" ""MOREsolution,"" ""PlasmaSORD,"" ""Powerplus,"" ""Rotocut,"" ""SAWALHE,"" ""Steiner,"" and ""X-Tract.""

Injuries involved the small and large bowels (n = 31), vascular system (n = 27), kidney (n = 3), ureter (n = 3), bladder (n = 1), and diaphragm (n = 1). Of these injuries, 11 involved more than 1 organ. Complications were identified intraoperatively in most patients (n = 37 [66%]); however, the remainder were not identified until up to 10 days postoperatively. Surgeon inexperience was a contributing factor in most cases in which a cause was ascribed. Six deaths were attributed to morcellator-related complications. Nearly all major complications were identified from the FDA device database and not from the published literature. The laparoscopic morcellator has substantially expanded our ability to complete procedures using minimally invasive techniques. Associated with this opportunity have been increasing reports of major and minor intraoperative complications. These complications are largely unreported, likely because of publication bias associated with catastrophic events. Surgeon experience likely confers some protection against these injuries.

24342704,Postmarketing safety of biologics and biological devices.,"Dec, 2013","BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Regardless of study design, the approval process of biologics and biological devices cannot identify every possible safety concern. Postmarketing safety surveillance can provide information based on real-world use of medical products in heterogeneous populations and is critical for identifying potentially serious adverse events, events that are too rare to be detected during premarketing studies, late complications, and events involving individuals or uses that were not evaluated in clinical trials. PURPOSE: To review why adverse event reporting is important and how the information is used, with emphasis on the points that are most applicable for surgeons and other spine professionals. METHODS: This is an overview of postmarketing safety surveillance. RESULTS: Review of adverse event reports has resulted in safety notifications, label changes, and publications regarding the safety of biologics and biological devices, such as the risk of airway compromise after the use of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein in cervical spine fusion, the occurrence of a fatal air embolism after the use of a fibrin sealant that had been applied with a spray device, and infections after allograft transplantation of human tissues.

We sought to analyze and investigate reports associated with the Essure hysteroscopic sterilization system (Conceptus Inc., Mountain View, CA) using this database. DESIGN: Retrospective review of the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database for events related to Essure hysteroscopic sterilization from November 2002 to February 2012 (Canadian Task Force Classification III). SETTING: Online retrospective review. PATIENTS: Online reports of patients who underwent Essure tubal sterilization. INTERVENTION: Essure tubal sterilization. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Four hundred fifty-seven adverse events were reported in the study period. Pain was the most frequently reported event (217 events [47.5%]) followed by delivery catheter malfunction (121 events [26.4%]). Poststerilization pregnancy was reported in 61 events (13.3%), of which 29 were ectopic pregnancies. Other reported events included perforation (90 events [19.7%]), abnormal bleeding (44 events [9.6%]), and microinsert malposition (33 events [7.2%]). The evaluation and management of these events resulted in an additional surgical procedure in 270 cases (59.1%), of which 44 were hysterectomies. CONCLUSION: Sixty-one unintended poststerilization pregnancies were reported in the study period, of which 29 (47.5%) were ectopic gestations.

24270729,Auricular burns associated with operating microscope use during otologic surgery.,"Nov, 2013","OBJECTIVE: To raise awareness of the potential hazard of auricular burns associated with operating microscope use during otologic surgery. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series and summary of the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database of voluntary adverse event reports pertaining to microscope related auricular thermal injuries. PATIENTS AND SETTING: All patients who sustained auricular burns while using the operating microscope during otologic surgery at 2 tertiary academic referral centers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Surgical procedure, microscope model, intensity of illumination, length of procedure, focal length, location and severity of burn, and patient outcome. RESULTS: A total of 4 microscope-related auricular thermal injuries were identified from the authors' institutions. Additionally, 82 unique cases of soft tissue burns associated with the use of an operative microscope have been voluntarily reported to the FDA since 2004. A disproportionately large percent (∼ 30%) of these occurred within the field of otology, the majority of which were during tympanoplasty or tympanomastoidectomy procedures at focal length distances of 300 mm or less with xenon light source microscopes. CONCLUSION: Simultaneous advancements in light delivery technologies and lens optics have continued to improve the efficiency of the operating microscope; however, these improvements also increase the potential for thermal injuries. Although rare, a review of the FDA MAUDE database suggests that microscope-related soft tissue burns occur more frequently in otology than any other surgical specialty. A variety of factors may help explain this finding, including the unique anatomy of the external ear with thin skin and limited underlying adipose tissue.

DESIGN: Retrospective review of commercial data compiled from the MAUDE database, medical literature, and manufacturer reports received during commercial distribution of hysteroscopic sterilization micro-inserts from 2001 through 2010 (Canadian Taskforce classification III descriptive study). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: From 2001 through 2010, 497 305 hysteroscopic sterilization kits were distributed worldwide, and 748 pregnancies were reported, i.e., 0.15% of the estimated user population based on the number of distributed kits. The data were sufficient to enable analysis of 508 pregnancies for potential contributing factors and showed most to be associated with patient or physician noncompliance (n = 264) or misinterpreted confirmation tests (n = 212). Conceptions deemed to have occurred within 2 weeks of the procedure and therefore too early for detection were identified in 32 cases. CONCLUSION: Although there are limitations to the dataset and the study design is retrospective, it represents the largest body of cumulative hysteroscopic sterilization data available to date. Of the 748 pregnancies reported, it is apparent that some might have been prevented with greater patient and clinician attention to interim contraceptive use and counseling and with more rigorous evaluation and informed interpretation of the procedure confirmation tests.

23871705,Early fatigue fractures in the IS-1 connector leg of a small-diameter ICD lead: value of returned product analysis for improving device safety.,"Jul, 2013","BACKGROUND: Conductor fractures may affect the performance of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator leads. During routine surveillance of returned product analyses (RPAs) in the Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturers and User Facility Device Experience database, we found a number of conductor fractures in small diameter implantable cardioverter-defibrillator leads manufactured by St Jude Medical, Inc (SJM, Sylmar, CA). OBJECTIVES: To determine the location and cause of these fractures and to catalog their clinical signs and consequences. METHODS: We searched the FDA's Manufacturers and User Facility Device Experience database on April 11, 2013. SJM provided information and data it collected independently. RESULTS: Our search found 59 leads with fractures in the IS-1 leg. Most fractures were in leads implanted in 2008-2009; no fractures were found in leads implanted after 2010. Outer coil conductor fractures accounted for the majority (51 of 59, 86%). Oversensing and noise were common signs, and 81% of the patients received inappropriate shocks. SJM's RPAs found that the fractures were due to inadequate strain relief and redesigned the IS-1 leg by shortening the crimp bore. Younger age and subpectoral implants appeared to be associated with these fractures. SJM stated the incidence is low (0.040%) and has not seen further fractures of this type in leads with the modified crimp. CONCLUSIONS: SJM's small diameter leads that were manufactured before 2011 are prone to early outer coil fatigue fractures in the IS-1 leg. The failure mechanism appears to have been mitigated by a design change.

23796092,Distribution of reported StarClose SE vascular closure device complications in the manufacturer and user facility device experience database.,"Jun, 2013","PURPOSE: To evaluate the type and frequency of complications associated with the StarClose SE vascular closure device reported to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database for comparison with complications reported in clinical trials. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Complications reported in the MAUDE database related to use of the StarClose SE vascular closure device were reviewed. Keyword searches by device and manufacturer were performed for a 16-month period from July 2009-October 2010. Reports were analyzed according to complication type, frequency, and resolution, if specified. These data were compared with data on StarClose SE device complications, which included three prospective randomized trials and five prospective nonrandomized trials. RESULTS: Keyword searches returned 1,107 total records and 1,118 categorizable StarClose SE device complications from the 16-month MAUDE database-reporting period. Complications in order of frequency (absolute number and relative frequency, respectively) included failure to achieve hemostasis (409, 36.6%), inability to complete the deployment sequence (268, 24.0%), entrapped deployment device (224, 20%), clip not deployed (151,13.5%), late bleeding or oozing from dermatotomy site (25, 2.2%), vessel occlusion (19, 1.7%), retroperitoneal hematoma (12, 1.1%), pseudoaneurysm formation (6, 0.5%) and death (4, 0.4%). The distribution of complications differed appreciably from the combined adverse events compiled from the published trials evaluating the StarClose SE device. There were no records describing inability to remove the deployment device in the published trials, whereas this represented the third most common complication reported to the MAUDE database. Bleeding or oozing from the dermatotomy site, the most frequent relative complication reported in the published literature (53.4%), represented 2.2% of the total complications reported to the MAUDE database. CONCLUSIONS: The type and frequency of complications reported in the MAUDE database on the StarClose SE vascular closure device differ from those published in clinical trials both in relative distribution and in type.

23761875,Reporting the impact of inferior vena cava perforation by filters.,"Jun, 2013","BACKGROUND: Perforation of the inferior vena cava by filters struts is a known complication. The goal of our review is to assess the impact of inferior vena cava perforation by filters based on an open, voluntary national database. METHODS: We reviewed 3311 adverse events of inferior vena cava filters reported in Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database from January 2000 to June 2011. Outcomes of interest were incidence of inferior vena cava perforation, type of filter, clinical presentation, and management of the perforation, including retrievability rates. RESULTS: Three hundred ninety-one (12%) cases of inferior vena cava perforation were reported. The annual distribution of inferior vena cava perforation was 35 cases (9%), varying from seven (2%) to 70 (18%). A three-fold increment in the number of adverse events related to inferior vena cava filters has been noted since 2004. Wall perforation as an incidental finding was the most common presentation (N = 268, 69%). Surrounding organ involvement was found in 117 cases (30%), with the aorta being the most common in 43 cases (37%), followed by small bowel in 36 (31%). Filters were retrieved in 97 patients (83%) regardless of wall perforation. Twenty-five (26%) cases required an open procedure to remove the filter. Neither major bleeding requiring further intervention nor mortality was reported. CONCLUSIONS: Inferior vena cava perforation by filters remains stable over the studied years despite increasing numbers of adverse events reported.

23666777,Using statistical text classification to identify health information technology incidents.,"May, 2013","OBJECTIVE: To examine the feasibility of using statistical text classification to automatically identify health information technology (HIT) incidents in the USA Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. DESIGN: We used a subset of 570 272 incidents including 1534 HIT incidents reported to MAUDE between 1 January 2008 and 1 July 2010. Text classifiers using regularized logistic regression were evaluated with both 'balanced' (50% HIT) and 'stratified' (0.297% HIT) datasets for training, validation, and testing. Dataset preparation, feature extraction, feature selection, cross-validation, classification, performance evaluation, and error analysis were performed iteratively to further improve the classifiers. Feature-selection techniques such as removing short words and stop words, stemming, lemmatization, and principal component analysis were examined. MEASUREMENTS: κ statistic, F1 score, precision and recall. RESULTS: Classification performance was similar on both the stratified (0.954 F1 score) and balanced (0.995 F1 score) datasets. Stemming was the most effective technique, reducing the feature set size to 79% while maintaining comparable performance. Training with balanced datasets improved recall (0.989) but reduced precision (0.165). CONCLUSIONS: Statistical text classification appears to be a feasible method for identifying HIT reports within large databases of incidents. Automated identification should enable more HIT problems to be detected, analyzed, and addressed in a timely manner.

23586003,Technical accuracy of optical and the electromagnetic tracking systems.,"Apr, 2013","Thousands of operations are annually guided with computer assisted surgery (CAS) technologies. As the use of these devices is rapidly increasing, the reliability of the devices becomes ever more critical. The problem of accuracy assessment of the devices has thus become relevant. During the past five years, over 200 hazardous situations have been documented in the MAUDE database during operations using these devices in the field of neurosurgery alone. Had the accuracy of these devices been periodically assessed pre-operatively, many of them might have been prevented. The technical accuracy of a commercial navigator enabling the use of both optical (OTS) and electromagnetic (EMTS) tracking systems was assessed in the hospital setting using accuracy assessment tools and methods developed by the authors of this paper. The technical accuracy was obtained by comparing the positions of the navigated tool tip with the phantom accuracy assessment points. Each assessment contained a total of 51 points and a region of surgical interest (ROSI) volume of 120x120x100 mm roughly mimicking the size of the human head. The error analysis provided a comprehensive understanding of the trend of accuracy of the surgical navigator modalities. This study showed that the technical accuracies of OTS and EMTS over the pre-determined ROSI were nearly equal. However, the placement of the particular modality hardware needs to be optimized for the surgical procedure.

From these data we identified some root causes of failures as well as trends that may assist surgeons and users of the robotic technology. METHODS: We conducted a survey of the MAUDE database and tallied robotic instrument failures that occurred between January 2009 and December 2010. We categorized failures into five main groups (cautery, shaft, wrist or tool tip, cable, and control housing) based on technical differences in instrument design and function. RESULTS: A total of 565 instrument failures were documented through 528 reports. The majority of failures (285) were of the instrument's wrist or tool tip. Cautery problems comprised 174 failures, 76 were shaft failures, 29 were cable failures, and 7 were control housing failures. Of the reports, 10 had no discernible failure mode and 49 exhibited multiple failures. CONCLUSIONS: The data show that a number of robotic instrument failures occurred in a short period of time. In reality, many instrument failures may go unreported, thus a true failure rate cannot be determined from these data. However, education of hospital administrators, operating room staff, surgeons, and patients should be incorporated into discussions regarding the introduction and utilization of robotic technology.

RESULTS: Through December 31, 2011, the FDA has received 62 reports of adverse events involving rhBMP-2 in nonspinal orthopaedic procedures. Surgical site infections and other wound complications, heterotopic bone, pseudarthrosis, and local inflammation were among the most commonly reported adverse events. Almost half of the reports (30 reports; 48%) stated that the patients required secondary interventions to address the reported adverse events. The majority (49 reports; 79%) described adverse events occurring after unapproved uses, such as management of tibial plateau fractures, treatment of congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia, and humeral reconstruction. CONCLUSIONS: Serious adverse events can occur after the use of rhBMP-2 in nonspinal orthopaedic procedures and may necessitate additional surgery. Most events in this analysis occurred after off-label uses.

23074426,Multiple intravenous infusions phase 1b: practice and training scan.,"Oct, 2012","BACKGROUND: Minimal research has been conducted into the potential patient safety issues related to administering multiple intravenous (IV) infusions to a single patient. Previous research has highlighted that there are a number of related safety risks. In Phase 1a of this study, an analysis of 2 national incident-reporting databases (Institute for Safe Medical Practices Canada and United States Food and Drug Administration MAUDE) found that a high percentage of incidents associated with the administration of multiple IV infusions resulted in patient harm. OBJECTIVES: The primary objectives of Phase 1b of this study were to identify safety issues with the potential to cause patient harm stemming from the administration of multiple IV infusions; and to identify how nurses are being educated on key principles required to safely administer multiple IV infusions. DATA SOURCES AND REVIEW METHODS: A field study was conducted at 12 hospital clinical units (sites) across Ontario, and telephone interviews were conducted with program coordinators or instructors from both the Ontario baccalaureate nursing degree programs and the Ontario postgraduate Critical Care Nursing Certificate programs. Data were analyzed using Rasmussen's 1997 Risk Management Framework and a Health Care Failure Modes and Effects Analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-two primary patient safety issues were identified with the potential to directly cause patient harm. Seventeen of these (critical issues) were categorized into 6 themes. A cause-consequence tree was established to outline all possible contributing factors for each critical issue. Clinical recommendations were identified for immediate distribution to, and implementation by, Ontario hospitals. Future investigation efforts were planned for Phase 2 of the study. LIMITATIONS: This exploratory field study identifies the potential for errors, but does not describe the direct observation of such errors, except in a few cases where errors were observed. Not all issues are known in advance, and the frequency of errors is too low to be observed in the time allotted and with the limited sample of observations. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of multiple IV infusions to a single patient is a complex task with many potential associated patient safety risks. Improvements to infusion and infusion-related technology, education standards, clinical best practice guidelines, hospital policies, and unit work practices are required to reduce the risk potential. This report makes several recommendations to Ontario hospitals so that they can develop an awareness of the issues highlighted in this report and minimize some of the risks.

23063031,Pediatric use of insulin pump technology: a retrospective study of adverse events in children ages 1-12 years.,"Oct, 2012","BACKGROUND: Growing technological improvements in insulin pump design have increased the use of these devices in young children. To better understand the types of infusion pump-related problems and associated adverse events in this age group, we performed a comprehensive evaluation of pump-related adverse event reports received by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for children ages 1-12 years. METHODS: A query was conducted of FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database from January 1, 1996, through December 31, 2009, in children ages 1-12 years involving insulin pumps. Report narratives were individually reviewed for age, gender, and seriousness of outcomes. Device or patient problems and potential contributory factors were assessed. RESULTS: Over the past 14 years, 1774 (7%) of all insulin pump adverse event reports were identified in children ages 1-12. Of these reports, 777 (43%) resulted in hospitalization. In hospitalized cases (n = 614), diabetic ketoacidosis and/or hyperglycemia were the predominant patient problems, and in other cases (n = 98), hypoglycemia was evident. There were 106 emergency room visits, 19 cases requiring paramedic attention, and five deaths. The majority of reports indicated that the devices were not returned to the manufacturer, and root causes were not always confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: Younger children with diabetes deserve careful consideration of the risk and benefit of insulin pump technology. Studies are needed to better understand pediatric safety issues and to identify the root cause of adverse events. Problems related to patient education, device misuse, and malfunctions were found, highlighting the need to strengthen user training for children and their caregivers.",No Full Text Available,pediatric use of insulin pump technology a retrospective study of adverse events in children ages  years,background growing technological improvements in insulin pump design have increased the use of these devices in young children to better understand the types of infusion pumprelated problems and associated adverse events in this age group we performed a comprehensive evaluation of pumprelated adverse event reports received by the us food and drug administration fda for children ages  years methods a query was conducted of fdas manufacturer and user facility device experience database from january   through december   in children ages  years involving insulin pumps report narratives were individually reviewed for age gender and seriousness of outcomes device or patient problems and potential contributory factors were assessed results over the past  years   of all insulin pump adverse event reports were identified in children ages  of these reports   resulted in hospitalization in hospitalized cases n   diabetic ketoacidosis andor hyperglycemia were the predominant patient problems and in other cases n   hypoglycemia was evident there were  emergency room visits  cases requiring paramedic attention and five deaths the majority of reports indicated that the devices were not returned to the manufacturer and root causes were not always confirmed conclusions younger children with diabetes deserve careful consideration of the risk and benefit of insulin pump technology studies are needed to better understand pediatric safety issues and to identify the root cause of adverse events problems related to patient education device misuse and malfunctions were found highlighting the need to strengthen user training for children and their caregivers,pediatric use insulin pump technology retrospective study adverse event child age year background growing technological improvement insulin pump design increased use device young child better understand type infusion pumprelated problem associated adverse event age group performed comprehensive evaluation pumprelated adverse event report received u food drug administration fda child age year method query conducted fda manufacturer user facility device experience database january december child age year involving insulin pump report narrative individually reviewed age gender seriousness outcome device patient problem potential contributory factor assessed result past year insulin pump adverse event report identified child age report resulted hospitalization hospitalized case n diabetic ketoacidosis andor hyperglycemia predominant patient problem case n hypoglycemia evident emergency room visit case requiring paramedic attention five death majority report indicated device returned manufacturer root cause always confirmed conclusion younger child diabetes deserve careful consideration risk benefit insulin pump technology study needed better understand pediatric safety issue identify root cause adverse event problem related patient education device misuse malfunction found highlighting need strengthen user training child caregiver,Uncertain
23098616,Recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2: adverse events reported to the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database.,"Oct, 2012","BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Adverse effects of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) in spinal surgery have previously been observed. However, because of its size, scope, and nature, the US Food and Drug Administration's database of postmarketing reports is useful for detecting new and unexpected safety concerns. PURPOSE: To characterize adverse events reported to the FDA; to characterize off-label use of rhBMP-2. STUDY DESIGN: Review of adverse events reported to the FDA after the use of rhBMP-2 (INFUSE Bone Graft) in spinal surgery. METHODS: The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database was searched for the brand name ""infuse bone graft,"" for reports received from July 2, 2002, through August 31, 2011. Adverse events were reviewed, summarized, and classified by an MD. For each report, the most important clinical entity was identified as the principal adverse event. Off-label uses were summarized. RESULTS: Of 834 reports, four (0.5%) described procedures in which rhBMP-2 was used in accordance with the approved indication. Nearly half of all the reports, 370 (44.4%), stated that the patient required revision surgery or other invasive interventions to address the reported adverse event. Swelling, fluid collections, osteolysis, pain/radiculopathy, heterotopic bone, pseudarthrosis, surgical site infections and other wound complications, thromboembolic events, respiratory distress, cancer, and other events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Because of their duration, scope, and expense, prospective studies designed to estimate the risk of rare adverse events may be impractical. Despite its imperfections, postmarketing surveillance helps to narrow the focus by revealing patterns and prioritizing topics for further research. One should not extrapolate from these results to the rhBMP-2 experience as a whole; the findings reported here might not be representative.

22996104,Minimally invasive endometrial ablation device complications and use outside of the manufacturers' instructions.,"Sep, 2012","OBJECTIVE: To review the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database for reports describing serious adverse events and adverse events reports describing use outside of the manufacturers' labeled instructions for the five FDA-approved minimally invasive endometrial ablation devices. METHODS: We queried the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database for reports of device malfunction, patient injury, or death reported for each device from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2011. We reviewed U.S. reports individually for annotations of patient injury or death and tabulated the reports by type of injury and device. We identified nine categories of serious injury (death, sepsis or bacteremia, intra-abdominal abscess, uterine rupture, thermal bowel injury, mechanical bowel injury, transmural uterine thermal injury, urologic injury, and lower genital tract or skin burns) and noted all reports citing device use outside of the manufacturers' labeled instructions. We also identified reports of hysterectomy or bowel resection attributable to an adverse event. RESULTS: Serious adverse events, including bowel injury (n=128), sepsis or bacteremia (n=47), intra-abdominal abscess (n=18), urologic injury (n=2), and uterine rupture (n=1) were reported. Death was also reported (n=4). Eight percent (66 of 829) of serious adverse events reports cited use outside of the manufacturers' labeled instructions, as did 7.3% (6 of 82) of reports citing need for hysterectomy and 8.7% (9 of 103) of reports of bowel resection.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We searched the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) Manufacturers and User Device Experience (MAUDE) database on 13 April 2012 using the simple search terms 'Riata ST Optim™ abrasion analysis' and 'Durata abrasion analysis'. Lead implant time was estimated by subtracting 3 months from the reported lead age. The MAUDE search returned 15 reports for Riata ST Optim™ and 37 reports for Durata leads, which were submitted by SJM based on its analyses of returned leads for clinical events that occurred between December 2007 and January 2012. Riata ST Optim™ leads had been implanted 29.1 ± 11.7 months. Eight of 15 leads had can abrasions and three abrasions were caused by friction with another device, most likely another lead. Four of these abrasions resulted in high-voltage failures and one death. One failure was caused by an internal insulation defect. Durata leads had been implanted 22.2 ± 10.6 months. Twelve Durata leads had can abrasions, and six leads had abrasions caused by friction with another device. Of these 18 can and other device abrasions, 13 (72%) had electrical abnormalities. Low impedances identified three internal insulation abrasions. CONCLUSIONS: Riata ST Optim™ and Durata ICD leads have failed due to insulation abrasions.

22919127,Mesh complications in female pelvic floor reconstructive surgery and their management: A systematic review.,"Aug, 2012","We reviewed the incidence, predisposing factors, presentation and management of complications related to the use of synthetic mesh in the management of stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse repair. Immediate complications, such as bleeding, hematoma, injury to adjacent organs during placement of mesh and complication of voiding dysfunction are not discussed in this review, since they are primarily related to technique. A PubMed search of related articles published in English was done from April 2008 to March 2011. Key words used were urinary incontinence, mesh, complications, midurethral sling, anterior prolapse, anterior vaginal repair, pelvic organ prolapse, transvaginal mesh, vault prolapse, midurethral slings, female stress urinary incontinence, mesh erosion, vaginal mesh complications, and posterior vaginal wall prolapse. Since there were very few articles dealing with the management of mesh-related complications in the period covered in the search we extended the search from January 2005 onwards. Articles were selected to fit the scope of the topic. In addition, landmark publications and Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) data (FDA website) were included on the present topic. A total of 170 articles were identified. The use of synthetic mesh in sub-urethral sling procedures is now considered the standard for the surgical management of stress urinary incontinence. Synthetic mesh is being increasingly used in the management of pelvic organ prolapse. While the incidence of extrusion and erosion with mid-urethral sling is low, the extrusion rate in prolapse repair is somewhat higher and the use in posterior compartment remains controversial. When used through the abdominal approach the extrusion and erosion rates are lower. The management of mesh complication is an individualized approach.

22806510,The unacknowledged incidence of laparoscopic stapler malfunction.,"Jul, 2012","BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic instruments are being used with increasing frequency. Our surgeons recently experienced several independent adverse events involving the laparoscopic linear stapler. Although the Food and Drug Administration maintains a Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database to track such voluntary reports, many events are not reported and the true incidence of adverse events is unknown. We attempted to determine how frequently minimally invasive surgeons have experienced technical problems with a laparoscopic stapler. METHODS: Following IRB approval, we electronically distributed an anonymous 10-question survey to the 124 minimally invasive program directors listed in the Fellowship Council database. The questions focused on personal or peer experience with laparoscopic stapler malfunction, frequency and type of malfunction, device manufacturer, whether the operation was altered, and root cause analysis of the event. RESULTS: Forty-four of the 124 program directors (35%) completed the survey. The majority reported personal or peer experience (86%) with a linear stapler not releasing (66%) or not firing (73%) after application, with 27% of the respondents noting that this occurred three or more times. The malfunction was not related to type of load, straight (23%) or reticulating (32%) model, or manufacturer (Ethicon 30%, Covidien 36%). One quarter of the respondents noted that the malfunction caused them to significantly alter their operative procedure, and 30% reported that they received no helpful feedback from the manufacturer despite contacting it.

Evidence-based methodology is used, with a MEDLINE literature search to identify pertinent preclinical and clinical studies on the topic and a MAUDE (U.S. Food and Drug Administration Center for Devices and Radiological Health) database search to identify the reported complications of a given technology. Both are supplemented by accessing the ""related articles"" feature of PubMed and by scrutinizing pertinent references cited by the identified studies. Controlled clinical trials are emphasized, but in many cases, data from randomized, controlled trials are lacking. In such cases, large case series, preliminary clinical studies, and expert opinions are used.

22381263,"Longitudinal stent deformation: insights on mechanisms, treatments and outcomes from the Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database.","Mar, 2012","AIMS: Longitudinal stent deformation (LSD) is a recently described complication of PCI, but mechanisms contributing to its occurrence and associated clinical outcomes remain unclear. The FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was searched to identify cases of LSD to gain insight into procedural and anatomical factors that predispose to this complication and associated clinical outcomes. METHODS AND RESULTS: The MAUDE database is a voluntary international electronic reporting system whose aim is to capture major adverse events involving medical devices. Using defined search terms, we identified 57 unique cases of LSD ranging from 2004-2011. A significant increase in the reporting of LSD in the last two years was observed with most reported cases in stents based on the Element platform (90%). The lesions in which LSD was reported were complex (vessel calcification 26%; tortuosity 25%; long 28%; ostial disease 21%) and most frequently occurred following attempts to pass or withdraw secondary devices through a previously deployed stent (89% cases where mechanism identified). Adverse clinical outcomes including emergent cardiac surgery and acute and sub-acute stent thrombosis occurred in eight cases. CONCLUSIONS: LSD can occur secondary to a variety of mechanisms; identification and treatment is important since adverse incidents such as emergent CABG and stent thrombosis may occur.

This is the latest of a number of reports to track the continuing problem of meningitis occurring in cochlear implant users, mainly children. RESULTS: Although a number of these patients had received a device with a 2-piece electrode, the withdrawal of that particular device has not prevented further cases from occurring. There are many potential etiologic factors potentially involved in postimplantation bacterial meningitis; although some can be managed or eliminated, vaccination against the most prevalent causal organism, the streptococcus pneumoniae, seems to be a powerful tool against this uncommon but serious complication of cochlear implantation.

The manufacturer announced a voluntary market withdrawal in October 2007. AIM: Our aim was to retrospectively evaluate this safety signal using disproportionality analysis to estimate whether disproportionality analysis could have detected this particular safety signal earlier than actually occurred. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database contains reports on device-related adverse events, of which, FDA receives several hundred thousand every year. For each manufacturer, a list of the top lead brand names was ranked by frequency of reports. We used the Multi-item Gamma Poisson Shrinker (MGPS) method for analysis. We isolated 11 top-reported implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) lead brand names. Using MGPS methodology, we calculated the one-sided 95% lower confidence bound EB05 on the empirical Bayes geometric mean of the reporting ratio. RESULTS: We performed individual MGPS analysis for each of the top reported adverse events in 2006 for ICD leads. Fidelis had the highest EB05 scores for lead fractures and inappropriate shock. DISCUSSION: Through disproportionality analysis of the MAUDE database, we were able to identify known safety signals associated with the Medtronic Sprint Fidelis lead.

To assess the types of malfunctions and associated outcomes for robotic cases and determine the extent to which experience and technological improvements impact these. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study is a retrospective review of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) MAUDE (Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience) database, a publicly available, voluntary reporting system (http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfmaude/search.cfm). The database was searched using the two phrases 'da Vinci' and 'Intuitive Surgical' from 2003 to 2009. Malfunctions of the instruments, console, patient-side cart, camera and cannula were recorded. Data on intraoperative injuries, case delays and conversions were also collected. RESULTS: In all, 1914 reports were reviewed (991 dVS and 878 dV, 45 unclassified) with peak years for reports of 2008 for dVS (571) and 2007 for dV (211), P < 0.001. With respect to time, the proportion of console and patient-side cart malfunctions declined from 2007 onward compared with the proportions prior to 2007 (5.1% vs 9.4% and 6.6% vs 10.9%). Patient injury did not change with year of surgery (0.5-5.4% of malfunctions, P= 0.358), open conversions declined (21.3% of malfunctions before 2007 vs 9.9% from 2007 onward, P < 0.001) and patient deaths increased (0.0013% of cases before 2007 vs 0.0061% of cases from 2007 onward, P < 0.001). With regard to robotic system, console and patient-side cart malfunctions were more frequent with the dV than the dVS: 82/878 vs 39/991 and 100/878 vs 48/991, P < 0.001. Open conversion was more frequent with dV than dVS (19.3% vs 7.7% of reported malfunctions, P < 0.001), while patient injury was less with dV than dVS (3.5% vs 5.9%, P= 0.021). CONCLUSIONS: The dVS decreased console and patient-side cart errors relative to total malfunctions, which were also influenced by surgical year.

21967534,Incidence and avoidance of neurologic complications with paddle type spinal cord stimulation leads.,"Oct, 2011","INTRODUCTION:   While reference is frequently made to the risk of spinal cord or nerve root injury with the surgical implantation of paddle type spinal cord stimulation (SCS) electrodes, data are lacking on the frequency, causes, and prevention of these complications. METHODS:   To determine the incidence and frequency of neurologic complications, we performed 1) a comprehensive analysis of the literature to determine the incidence of complications that have caused or could lead to neurologic injury; 2) an analysis of the US Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) data base; and 3) an investigation of manufacturers' data on surgically implanted paddle electrodes. We then convened an expert panel of neurosurgeons experienced in the surgical implantation of paddle electrodes to provide recommendations to minimize the risk of neurologic injury. RESULTS:   The scientific literature describes the breadth of neurologic complications that can result from SCS electrode implantation but does not provide interpretable data with respect to the incidence and frequency of these complications. The MAUDE data base is not constructed to be sensitive or specific enough to provide these critical data. Primary data show a risk of neurologic injury from implantation of paddle electrodes below 0.6%. DISCUSSION:   Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative measures to further minimize this risk are described. CONCLUSIONS:   This investigation, the first comprehensive evaluation of the incidence and frequency of neurologic injury as a result of SCS paddle electrode implantation, suggests that neurologic injury is a rare, but serious, complication of SCS. The incidence of these complications should be decreased by the adoption of approaches that improve procedural safety and by careful patient follow-up and complication management. Physicians should be aware of these approaches and take every precaution to reduce the risk of neurologic injury.

22024114,Systematic review of the use of retrievable inferior vena cava filters.,"Oct, 2011","PURPOSE: To review the available literature on retrievable inferior vena cava (IVC) filters to examine the effectiveness and risks of these devices. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Investigators searched MEDLINE for clinical trials evaluating retrievable filters and reviewed the complications reported to the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). RESULTS: Eligibility criteria were met by 37 studies comprising 6,834 patients. All of the trials had limitations, and no studies were randomized. There were 11 prospective clinical trials; the rest were retrospective studies. Despite the limitations of the evidence, the IVC filters seemed to be effective in preventing pulmonary embolism (PE); the rate of PE after IVC placement was 1.7%. The mean retrieval rate was 34%. Most of the filters became permanent devices. Multiple complications associated with the use of IVC filters were described in the reviewed literature or were reported to the MAUDE database; most of these were associated with long-term use (> 30 days). At the present time, the objective comparison data of different filter designs do not support superiority of any particular design. CONCLUSIONS: In high-risk patients for whom anticoagulation is not feasible, retrievable IVC filters seem to be effective in preventing PE. Long-term complications are a serious concern with the use of these filters.

21944871,Cardiac tamponade as a life-threatening complication in hernia repair.,"Sep, 2011","BACKGROUND: The placement of mesh in the repair of all types of hernia has been reported to decrease recurrence rates. There are several well known complications related to mesh repairs, including infection, erosion, seroma, and pain. Lesser reported are cardiac injuries secondary to anchoring of the mesh to the diaphragm. METHODS: We report 2 previously unreported, unpublished cases of cardiac tamponade after mesh fixation to the diaphragm and present a review of the literature and search of the US Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Device Experience (MAUDE) database. RESULTS: We reviewed a total of 10 cases of cardiac tamponade in hiatal hernia repair, 6 resulting in patient mortality, 5 cases in ventral hernia repair, 4 being fatal. Ten cases were caused by the helical tacker, 2 by sutures, 1 by the straight stapler, and in 1 case the cause was not identified. CONCLUSION: When anchoring mesh to the diaphragm, it is necessary to consider the risk of injury to the heart and cardiac tamponade, especially if the helical tacker is used in this region.

21903979,Using FDA reports to inform a classification for health information technology safety problems.,"Sep, 2011","OBJECTIVE: To expand an emerging classification for problems with health information technology (HIT) using reports submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. DESIGN: HIT events submitted to MAUDE were retrieved using a standardized search strategy. Using an emerging classification with 32 categories of HIT problems, a subset of relevant events were iteratively analyzed to identify new categories. Two coders then independently classified the remaining events into one or more categories. Free-text descriptions were analyzed to identify the consequences of events. MEASUREMENTS: Descriptive statistics by number of reported problems per category and by consequence; inter-rater reliability analysis using the κ statistic for the major categories and consequences. RESULTS: A search of 899 768 reports from January 2008 to July 2010 yielded 1100 reports about HIT. After removing duplicate and unrelated reports, 678 reports describing 436 events remained. The authors identified four new categories to describe problems with software functionality, system configuration, interface with devices, and network configuration; the authors' classification with 32 categories of HIT problems was expanded by the addition of these four categories. Examination of the 436 events revealed 712 problems, 96% were machine-related, and 4% were problems at the human-computer interface. Almost half (46%) of the events related to hazardous circumstances. Of the 46 events (11%) associated with patient harm, four deaths were linked to HIT problems (0.9% of 436 events). CONCLUSIONS: Only 0.1% of the MAUDE reports searched were related to HIT.

21872969,Analysis of automated external defibrillator device failures reported to the Food and Drug Administration.,"Aug, 2011","STUDY OBJECTIVE: Automated external defibrillators are essential for treatment of cardiac arrest by lay rescuers and must determine when to shock and if they are functioning correctly. We seek to characterize automated external defibrillator failures reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and whether battery failures are properly detected by automated external defibrillators. METHODS: FDA adverse event reports are catalogued in the Manufacturer and User Device Experience (MAUDE) database. We developed and internally validated an instrument for analyzing MAUDE data, reviewing all reports in which a fatality occurred. Two trained reviewers independently analyzed each report, and a third resolved discrepancies or passed them to a committee for resolution. RESULTS: One thousand two hundred eighty-four adverse events were reported between June 1993 and October 2008, of which 1,150 were failed defibrillation attempts. Thirty-seven automated external defibrillators never powered on, 252 failed to complete rhythm analysis, and 524 failed to deliver a recommended shock. In 149 cases, the operator disagreed with the device's rhythm analysis. In 54 cases, the defibrillator stated the batteries were low and in 110 other instances powered off unexpectedly. Interrater agreement between reviewers 1 and 2 ranged by question from 69.0% to 98.6% and for most likely cause was 55.9%. Agreement was obtained for 93.7% to 99.6% of questions by the third reviewer. Remaining discrepancies were resolved by the arbitration committee.

DESIGN: Case series (Canadian Task Force classification II-3). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Reports of suspected nickel hypersensitivity reported from 2001 through July 21, 2010, were collected from de-identified data obtained from the MAUDE (Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience) database and reports to the manufacturer directly from treating physicians, and published results for the 650 patients in the Phase II and Pivotal trials. Clinical outcomes and symptom resolution, when available, were obtained from de-identified information provided by the treating physicians to the manufacturer. Patients were not directly contacted for the study, and patient files were not reviewed. Patch testing was performed at the discretion of the treating physicians. Results were reported as positive or negative, without mention of the method or brand of patch testing used. CONCLUSION: Even considering the possibility of underreporting by several orders of magnitude, the reported incidence of adverse events suspected to be related to nickel hypersensitivity in patients with Essure micro-inserts is extremely small (0.01%). The incidence of confirmed nickel reactions is even smaller.

Variables extracted were the type of basket, malfunction and treatment, and patient outcome. RESULTS: We identified 556 adverse events related to stone baskets. The device configuration was tipped in 48% of cases, tipless in 36%, forceps in 8% and the Stone Cone™ in 8%. Malfunction type included detachment of a portion of the basket in 49% of cases, breakage without detachment in 39% and inability to withdraw the basket in 12%. Compared to the early period studied (1996 to 2004) there was a 3-fold increase in adverse events from 2005 to 2007 and a 6-fold increase from 2008 to 2009. Of adverse events 79% and 11% were managed by endoscopy and open surgery, respectively. Of the patients 42 experienced serious complications requiring major surgery, including ureteral reconstruction in 7, reimplantation in 4 and nephrectomy in 7.

Hydrophilic-coated sheaths designed specifically for trans-radial procedures have resulted in numerous reports of a foreign body reaction to retained material.

We searched the FDA MAUDE (Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience) database to determine which brands of sheath have been associated with this complication. In addition, we performed a literature search for all reported cases of this complication. Only one brand of sheath has been associated with this condition.

20806458,Stent fracture in the coronary and peripheral arteries.,"Sep, 2010","Inherent risks of stenting include restenosis and thrombosis. Recently, stent fractures have been recognized as a complication that may result in thrombosis, perforation, restenosis, and migration of the stent resulting in morbidity and mortality. Stent fractures were originally seen in the superficial femoral arteries but have since then been reported in almost all vascular sites including the coronary, renal, carotid, iliac, and femoropopliteal arteries. Fractures are the result of the complex interplay between stent manufacturing, the stented segment, pulsatile and nonpulsatile biomechanical forces, and plaque morphology at a particular vascular site. The presentation of a patient with a fracture is highly variable, ranging from asymptomatic in nature, detected on routine screening without any sequelae, to sudden cardiac death related to a thrombosed coronary artery. Despite being recognized as an important complication, consensus on routine surveillance and diagnostic methods to detect fractures continues to be lacking. Fortunately, most cases are relatively benign and can be managed conservatively if detected. In the setting of recurrent symptoms, further intervention is usually sought. In review of the literature most cases are managed with placement of a stent over the fractured area, the stent-in-stent technique, but several other alternatives may be available. As the knowledge of the variables that make stents prone to fracture are identified, better technologies and techniques can be employed to minimize the risk of this complication. This article reviews the available literature on stent fractures and complications using data found on PubMed, MEDLINE, the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database, and the Cochrane databases.",No Full Text Available,stent fracture in the coronary and peripheral arteries,inherent risks of stenting include restenosis and thrombosis recently stent fractures have been recognized as a complication that may result in thrombosis perforation restenosis and migration of the stent resulting in morbidity and mortality stent fractures were originally seen in the superficial femoral arteries but have since then been reported in almost all vascular sites including the coronary renal carotid iliac and femoropopliteal arteries fractures are the result of the complex interplay between stent manufacturing the stented segment pulsatile and nonpulsatile biomechanical forces and plaque morphology at a particular vascular site the presentation of a patient with a fracture is highly variable ranging from asymptomatic in nature detected on routine screening without any sequelae to sudden cardiac death related to a thrombosed coronary artery despite being recognized as an important complication consensus on routine surveillance and diagnostic methods to detect fractures continues to be lacking fortunately most cases are relatively benign and can be managed conservatively if detected in the setting of recurrent symptoms further intervention is usually sought in review of the literature most cases are managed with placement of a stent over the fractured area the stentinstent technique but several other alternatives may be available as the knowledge of the variables that make stents prone to fracture are identified better technologies and techniques can be employed to minimize the risk of this complication this article reviews the available literature on stent fractures and complications using data found on pubmed medline the manufacturer and user facility device experience maude database and the cochrane databases,stent fracture coronary peripheral artery inherent risk stenting include restenosis thrombosis recently stent fracture recognized complication may result thrombosis perforation restenosis migration stent resulting morbidity mortality stent fracture originally seen superficial femoral artery since reported almost vascular site including coronary renal carotid iliac femoropopliteal artery fracture result complex interplay stent manufacturing stented segment pulsatile nonpulsatile biomechanical force plaque morphology particular vascular site presentation patient fracture highly variable ranging asymptomatic nature detected routine screening without sequela sudden cardiac death related thrombosed coronary artery despite recognized important complication consensus routine surveillance diagnostic method detect fracture continues lacking fortunately case relatively benign managed conservatively detected setting recurrent symptom intervention usually sought review literature case managed placement stent fractured area stentinstent technique several alternative may available knowledge variable make stent prone fracture identified better technology technique employed minimize risk complication article review available literature stent fracture complication using data found pubmed medline manufacturer user facility device experience maude database cochrane database,Stent Fracture Adverse Events

20347546,Clinical relevance and treatment of carotid stent fractures.,"Mar, 2010","OBJECTIVE: To review all published reports and investigate the clinical relevance and need for treatment of carotid stent fractures. METHODS: Electronic and hand-searching of the published literature and the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. RESULTS: Thirteen articles were published. There are 10 case reports and 3 clinical studies. There are 26 reports of fractured stents in the MAUDE database. Fifty-five cases of carotid stent fractures are reported in total. A total of 201 carotid stents were examined in the 3 studies, and the incidence of fractures was 8.9% (18/201). Fractured stents were 22 Xact, 20 Acculink, 6 Precise, 2 Exponent, 1 Nexstent, 1 Genesis, 1 Symbiot, and 2 nonspecified nitinol self-expandable stents. Twenty-seven of the treated carotid lesions were atherosclerotic, 3 restenoses after carotid endarterectomy, 2 postradiational, 1 pseudoaneurysm, and 22 lesions of unknown pathology. Calcification was reported in 15 of the 27 atherosclerotic lesions (55.5%). Time from implantation to fracture ranged from 0 days (fracture during implantation) to 37 months. In 55% of the cases, stent fracture was associated with restenosis. Six patients presented with symptoms. Treatment was reported for 32 patients: 14 patients underwent de novo stent placement, 2 balloon angioplasty, 2 carotid endarterectomy, 2 bypass graft (1 vein, 1 polytetrafluoroethylene), 1 anticoagulation, and 11 patients were followed up. CONCLUSION: Carotid stent fractures are mainly reported in self-expandable nitinol stents. Plaque calcification may be a risk factor for stent fractures.

19946113,Deaths and cardiovascular injuries due to device-assisted implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and pacemaker lead extraction.,"Dec, 2009","AIMS: An estimated 10,000-15,000 pacemaker and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) leads are extracted annually worldwide using specialized tools that disrupt encapsulating fibrous tissue. Additional information is needed regarding the safety of the devices that have been approved for lead extraction. The aim of this study was to determine whether complications due to device-assisted lead extraction might be more hazardous than published data suggest, and whether procedural safety precautions are effective. METHODS AND RESULTS: We searched the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Manufacturers and User Defined Experience (MAUDE) database from 1995 to 2008 using the search terms 'lead extraction and death' and 'lead extraction and injury'. Additional product specific searches were performed for the terms 'death' and 'injury'. Between 1995 and 2008, 57 deaths and 48 serious cardiovascular injuries associated with device-assisted lead extraction were reported to the FDA. Owing to underreporting, the FDA database does not contain all adverse events that occurred during this period. Of the 105 events, 27 deaths and 13 injuries occurred in 2007-2008. During these 2 years, 23 deaths were linked with excimer laser or mechanical dilator sheath extractions. The majority of deaths and injuries involved ICD leads, and most were caused by lacerations of the right atrium, superior vena cava, or innominate vein. Overall, 62 patients underwent emergency surgical repair of myocardial perforations and venous lacerations and 35 (56%) survived. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that device-assisted lead extraction is a high-risk procedure and that serious complications including death may not be mitigated by emergency surgery. However, skilled standby cardiothoracic surgery is essential when performing pacemaker and ICD lead extractions. Although the incidence of these complications is unknown, the results of our study imply that device-assisted lead extractions should be performed by highly qualified physicians and their teams in specialized centres.",No Full Text Available,deaths and cardiovascular injuries due to deviceassisted implantable cardioverterdefibrillator and pacemaker lead extraction,aims an estimated  pacemaker and implantable cardioverterdefibrillator icd leads are extracted annually worldwide using specialized tools that disrupt encapsulating fibrous tissue additional information is needed regarding the safety of the devices that have been approved for lead extraction the aim of this study was to determine whether complications due to deviceassisted lead extraction might be more hazardous than published data suggest and whether procedural safety precautions are effective methods and results we searched the us food and drug administrations fda manufacturers and user defined experience maude database from  to  using the search terms lead extraction and death and lead extraction and injury additional product specific searches were performed for the terms death and injury between  and   deaths and  serious cardiovascular injuries associated with deviceassisted lead extraction were reported to the fda owing to underreporting the fda database does not contain all adverse events that occurred during this period of the  events  deaths and  injuries occurred in  during these  years  deaths were linked with excimer laser or mechanical dilator sheath extractions the majority of deaths and injuries involved icd leads and most were caused by lacerations of the right atrium superior vena cava or innominate vein overall  patients underwent emergency surgical repair of myocardial perforations and venous lacerations and   survived conclusion these findings suggest that deviceassisted lead extraction is a highrisk procedure and that serious complications including death may not be mitigated by emergency surgery however skilled standby cardiothoracic surgery is essential when performing pacemaker and icd lead extractions although the incidence of these complications is unknown the results of our study imply that deviceassisted lead extractions should be performed by highly qualified physicians and their teams in specialized centres,death cardiovascular injury due deviceassisted implantable cardioverterdefibrillator pacemaker lead extraction aim estimated pacemaker implantable cardioverterdefibrillator icd lead extracted annually worldwide using specialized tool disrupt encapsulating fibrous tissue additional information needed regarding safety device approved lead extraction aim study determine whether complication due deviceassisted lead extraction might hazardous published data suggest whether procedural safety precaution effective method result searched u food drug administration fda manufacturer user defined experience maude database using search term lead extraction death lead extraction injury additional product specific search performed term death injury death serious cardiovascular injury associated deviceassisted lead extraction reported fda owing underreporting fda database contain adverse event occurred period event death injury occurred year death linked excimer laser mechanical dilator sheath extraction majority death injury involved icd lead caused laceration right atrium superior vena cava innominate vein overall patient underwent emergency surgical repair myocardial perforation venous laceration survived conclusion finding suggest deviceassisted lead extraction highrisk procedure serious complication including death may mitigated emergency surgery however skilled standby cardiothoracic surgery essential performing pacemaker icd lead extraction although incidence complication unknown result study imply deviceassisted lead extraction performed highly qualified physician team specialized centre,Uncertain

Mechanism of action and injection techniques.,"Sep, 2009","After more than 25 years of research and development, in October 2006 ArteFill became the first and only permanent injectable wrinkle filler to receive FDA approval. ArteFill is a third-generation polymeric microsphere-based filler, following its predecessor Artecoll, which was marketed outside the United States between 1994 and 2006. ArteFill is approved for the correction of nasolabial folds and has been used in over 15,000 patients since its U.S. market introduction in February 2007. No serious side effects have been reported to date according to the FDA's MAUDE reporting database. ArteFill consists of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) microspheres (20% by volume), 30-50 microm in diameter, suspended in 3.5% bovine collagen solution (80% by volume) and 0.3% lidocaine. The collagen carrier is absorbed within 1 month after injection and completely replaced by the patient's own connective tissue within 3 months. Each cc of ArteFill contains approximately six million microspheres and histological studies have shown that long-term wrinkle correction consists of 80% of the patient's own connective tissue and 20% microspheres. The standard injection technique is subdermal tunneling that delivers a strand of ArteFill at the dermal-subdermal junction.

19614901,Indoor tanning injuries: an evaluation of FDA adverse event reporting data.,"Jul, 2009","BACKGROUND/AIMS: In 1979 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) designated indoor tanning units would be regulated medical devices and that each must have an exposure timer. In 1985 FDA added a scheduled series of doses designed to allow tanning with little risk of concomitant sunburn. Subsequently FDA/CDRH maintained databases in which medical device associated injuries were reported. The databases, MAUDE and its predecessor MDR, are available online. While these records, in part, are not intended for evaluation of adverse event rates, analysis provides insight into the etiology of UV-related tanning injuries. METHODS/RESULTS: We compiled 142 records reported for 1985-2006 including 22% noninjury malfunctions. Of the reported injuries approximately 50% resulted from UV exposure, an average of <1/year resulted in hospitalization. At least 36% of the UV-related injuries were attributable to various (user/operator) noncompliance with FDA sunlamp guidance policies. During 1985-1995 there were six times more UV injuries than 1996-2006, presumably reflecting cessation of much mandatory reporting in 1996. Injury reports declined steady from 1997 to 2006.

Nevertheless, the clinical implications of coronary stent fracture remain unclear. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A literature search for reports of DES fracture was conducted via MEDLINE, and the US Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was accessed via the internet and interrogated for reports of stent fracture between January 1, 2003, and April 30, 2008. Each report was reviewed, and clinical information was extracted for analysis. RESULTS: The MEDLINE search identified 202 cases of coronary DES fracture, with 95% of cases involving Cypher sirolimus-eluting stents. Clinical information regarding patient presentation was available in 96 cases. Patients presented with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or stent thrombosis in six cases (6%) and with unstable angina or non-STEMI (NSTEMI) in 40 cases (42%).

19530742,Patient-controlled analgesia-related medication errors in the postoperative period: causes and prevention.,"Jun, 2009","Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) is a common and effective means of managing postoperative pain. Unfortunately, the complex processes and equipment associated with the setup, programming and administration of intravenous or epidural PCA have allowed it to become a significant source of preventable medication errors. These errors can be classified into two major categories: human (operator) errors and equipment errors (malfunctions). Such errors are potentially harmful to patients, time-consuming for hospital staff and costly for healthcare providers. The objective of this article is to describe PCA medication errors and examine systems and modalities that may help reduce the incidence of system-related errors. Data from the US FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database indicate that 6.5% of intravenous PCA-related events were due to operator error. Most (81%) of these errors were due to pump misprogramming, of which almost half were associated with patient harm; 76.4% of adverse events were attributed to device malfunction (e.g. due to frayed wires or a crack in the drug cartridge), although only 0.5% of these were associated with harm to patients. In a report based on data from MEDMARX, a voluntary database that captures reports on medication errors, 7.9% of the PCA-related errors captured over a 5-year period were described as causing harm to patients. Technological advances, such as improved PCA pump designs based on ergonomic and cognitive engineering principles, the use of barcode technology and other 'smart pump' safety features, and new postoperative pain management modalities, may play a significant role in reducing the future incidence and severity of PCA medication errors.",No Full Text Available,patientcontrolled analgesiarelated medication errors in the postoperative period causes and prevention,patientcontrolled analgesia pca is a common and effective means of managing postoperative pain unfortunately the complex processes and equipment associated with the setup programming and administration of intravenous or epidural pca have allowed it to become a significant source of preventable medication errors these errors can be classified into two major categories human operator errors and equipment errors malfunctions such errors are potentially harmful to patients timeconsuming for hospital staff and costly for healthcare providers the objective of this article is to describe pca medication errors and examine systems and modalities that may help reduce the incidence of systemrelated errors data from the us fdas manufacturer and user facility device experience maude database indicate that  of intravenous pcarelated events were due to operator error most  of these errors were due to pump misprogramming of which almost half were associated with patient harm  of adverse events were attributed to device malfunction eg due to frayed wires or a crack in the drug cartridge although only  of these were associated with harm to patients in a report based on data from medmarx a voluntary database that captures reports on medication errors  of the pcarelated errors captured over a year period were described as causing harm to patients technological advances such as improved pca pump designs based on ergonomic and cognitive engineering principles the use of barcode technology and other smart pump safety features and new postoperative pain management modalities may play a significant role in reducing the future incidence and severity of pca medication errors,patientcontrolled analgesiarelated medication error postoperative period cause prevention patientcontrolled analgesia pca common effective mean managing postoperative pain unfortunately complex process equipment associated setup programming administration intravenous epidural pca allowed become significant source preventable medication error error classified two major category human operator error equipment error malfunction error potentially harmful patient timeconsuming hospital staff costly healthcare provider objective article describe pca medication error examine system modality may help reduce incidence systemrelated error data u fda manufacturer user facility device experience maude database indicate intravenous pcarelated event due operator error error due pump misprogramming almost half associated patient harm adverse event attributed device malfunction eg due frayed wire crack drug cartridge although associated harm patient report based data medmarx voluntary database capture report medication error pcarelated error captured year period described causing harm patient technological advance improved pca pump design based ergonomic cognitive engineering principle use barcode technology smart pump safety feature new postoperative pain management modality may play significant role reducing future incidence severity pca medication error,Medical Device Safety Incidents

METHODS: The Food and Drug Administration's medical device complication database, Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database (MAUDE), was evaluated for pure and hand-assisted laparoscopic donor nephrectomies from 1992 to 2007 with the broadest keywords possible. In an attempt to estimate the failure rates by device type, a ""denominator of use"" was calculated using Organ Procurement and Transplant Network data multiplied by previously published survey-determined usage rates. RESULTS: In the 92 complications identified, 59 (64%), 21 (23%), and 12 (13%) failures of endoscopic staplers, titanium clips, and locking clips had occurred, respectively. The most common mechanisms of stapler failure were missing/malformed staple lines (51%) and failure to release (25%). The most common titanium clip failures resulted from scissoring or malformation (52%), jamming (19%), and dislodgement (14%). Clip dislodgement was most common with the locking clip, either postoperatively in 7 (58%) or intraoperatively in 3 (25%). Intraoperative conversions were required for 21 (36%), 1 (5%), and 2 (17%) for staplers, titanium clips, and locking clips, respectively. The estimated overall failure rate was 3.0% for staplers, 4.9% for titanium clips, and 1.7% for locking clips.

19468005,Ambulance stretcher adverse events.,"May, 2009","INTRODUCTION: Ambulance personnel use wheeled stretchers for moving patients in the out-of-hospital setting. The nature of adverse events and associated injuries occurring during ambulance stretcher operation was characterised. METHODS: Data from the United States Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database (MAUDE) were used. All adverse events involving ambulance stretchers during the years 1996-2005 were identified. The nature of the event, the method of stretcher handling, the individuals injured and the nature of the resulting injuries were identified. RESULTS: There were 671 reported adverse events. The most common adverse events were stretcher collapse (54%; 95% CI 50 to 57%), broken, missing or malfunctioning part (28%; 95% CI 25 to 32%) and dropped stretcher (7%; 95% CI 5 to 9%). Adverse events most commonly occurred during unloading of the stretcher from the ambulance (16%; 13 to 19%). Injuries occurred in 121 events (18%; 95% CI 15 to 21%), most often involving sprains/strains (29%), fractures (16%) and lacerations/avulsions (13%).

19464444,Analysis of the US Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database for adverse events involving Amplatzer septal occluder devices and comparison with the Society of Thoracic Surgery congenital cardiac surgery database.,"May, 2009","OBJECTIVE: Amplatzer (AGA Medical Corporation, Plymouth, Minn) septal and vascular occluder devices have significantly altered the care of patients with congenital heart disease. The relative frequency and consequence of complications resulting from the attempted placement of such devices, however, have not been well assessed. The purpose of this study is to use large databases to assess the frequency and severity of such complications and compare them with those of surgical atrial septal defect closure. METHODS: The US Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database was quarried for all adverse events for Amplatzer septal occluder devices, which were categorized and analyzed with particular emphasis on management and outcome. The Society of Thoracic Surgery database was likewise quarried for the same data regarding atrial septal defect closures over a contemporaneous time period. By using a literature-derived denominator for total Amplatzer implant numbers, the results of the 2 therapies were compared. RESULTS: Since July 1, 2002, 223 adverse events in patients undergoing Amplatzer atrial septal defect closure were submitted to the Food and Drug Administration, resulting in 17 deaths (7.6%) and 152 surgical rescue operations (68.2%). Society of Thoracic Surgery data demonstrated 1537 primary operations with 2 deaths (0.13%) and 6 reoperations (0.39%). By extrapolating on published estimates of Amplatzer implantation to provide an implant denominator (n = 18,333), there was no difference between overall mortality for surgical (0.13%) and device closure (0.093%, P = .649). Rescue operation for device adverse events (0.83%) was 2.1 times more likely than reoperation for surgical closure (0.39%, P = .063). Mortality per adverse event was higher for device closure (7.6%) than for surgical closure (1.2%, P = .004), and the need for surgery per adverse event was higher for device closure (68.2%) than for surgical closure (3.6%, P < .001). The mortality for surgical management of a device adverse event (2.6%) was 20-fold higher than for primary elective atrial septal defect closure (0.13%, P < .0001). CONCLUSION: Overall crude mortality for device and surgical closure atrial septal defect closure is equivalent, and the need for subsequent operation (surgical rescue) is more common in patients undergoing device closure than reoperation is in patients undergoing surgical closure. Complications from device closure tend to be serious and most often require urgent or emergency operative management, whereas the mortality for surgical management of a device complication appears higher than that of elective atrial septal defect closure.

19322228,The NTI-tss device may be used successfully in the management of bruxism and TMD.,"Mar, 2009","DATA SOURCES: The Cochrane Library, Medline, TRIP database, MEDPILOT.DE, BIREME, several German-language journals, Google Scholar, the Web of Science, NTI-tss-associated websites , references of relevant articles and the MAUDE database of adverse events. STUDY SELECTION: Randomised controlled trials (RCT) were included and their quality was assessed using the Jadad score. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: A qualitative synthesis was carried out. RESULTS: Nine out of 68 relevant publications reported the results of five different RCT. Two RCT concentrated on electromyographic (EMG) investigations in patients with temporomandibular disorders (TMD) and concomitant bruxism or with bruxism alone. In both studies, the NTI-tss device showed significant reduction of EMG activity compared with use of an occlusal stabilisation splint. Two RCT focused exclusively on TMD patients: in one, a stabilisation appliance led to greater improvement than use of an NTI-tss device, whereas in the other no difference was found. In a further RCT, participants who suffered from tension-type headaches or migraines responded more favourably to the NTI-tss splint than to a bleaching tray. NTI-tss-induced complications related predominantly to single teeth or to the occlusion. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from RCT suggests that the NTI-tss device may be successfully used for the management of bruxism and TMD.

18662411,"The NTI-tss device for the therapy of bruxism, temporomandibular disorders, and headache - where do we stand? A qualitative systematic review of the literature.","Jul, 2008","BACKGROUND: The NTI-tss device is an anterior bite stop, which, according to the manufacturer, is indicated for the prevention and treatment of bruxism, temporomandibular disorders (TMDs), tension-type headaches, and migraine. The aim of this systematic review was to appraise the currently available evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of the NTI-tss splint. METHODS: We performed a systematic search in nine electronic databases and in NTI-tss-associated websites (last update: December 31, 2007). The reference lists of all relevant articles were perused. Five levels of scientific quality were distinguished. Reporting quality of articles about randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was evaluated using the Jadad score. To identify adverse events, we searched in the identified publications and in the MAUDE database. RESULTS: Nine of 68 relevant publications reported about the results of five different RCTs. Two RCTs concentrated on electromyographic (EMG) investigations in patients with TMDs and concomitant bruxism (Baad-Hansen et al 2007, Jadad score: 4) or with bruxism alone (Kavakli 2006, Jadad score: 2); in both studies, compared to an occlusal stabilization splint the NTI-tss device showed significant reduction of EMG activity. Two RCTs focused exclusively on TMD patients; in one trial (Magnusson et al 2004, Jadad score: 3), a stabilization appliance led to greater improvement than an NTI-tss device, while in the other study (Jokstad et al 2005, Jadad score: 5) no difference was found. In one RCT (Shankland 2002, Jadad score: 1), patients with tension-type headache or migraine responded more favorably to the NTI-tss splint than to a bleaching tray. NTI-tss-induced complications related predominantly to single teeth or to the occlusion. CONCLUSION: Evidence from RCTs suggests that the NTI-tss device may be successfully used for the management of bruxism and TMDs.

To understand better the types of infusion pump-related problems in adolescents, we performed a comprehensive evaluation of insulin and patient-controlled analgesic pump-related adverse events reported for adolescents that were received by the Food and Drug Administration from 1996 to 2005. METHODS: A search for medical device adverse event reports from January 1, 1996 through December 31, 2005, involving insulin pumps or patient-controlled analgesic pumps used by patients who were aged 12 to 21 years was conducted in the Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database. Reports were reviewed for demographic characteristics, type of adverse event, and patient morbidity, and potential contributory factors were classified from narratives in the reports. RESULTS: A total of 1674 reports were identified: 1594 for insulin pumps and 53 for patient-controlled analgesic pumps. In reports of insulin pump events, there were 13 reported deaths, 2 reports that indicated possible suicide attempts, and several additional reports indicating severe hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events that seemed to be device-related. A total of 102 (6.4%) insulin-pump reports highlighted factors that may have contributed to the adverse event, including problems associated with compliance, education, sports-related activities, and dropping or damaging the pump. Eighty-two percent of cases involving the insulin pump resulted in hospitalization. Half of the reports involving patient-controlled analgesic pumps indicated that the patient received an excess of medication; tampering and noncompliance were evident in some cases.

18377477,Major complications associated with transcatheter atrial septal occluder implantation: a review of the medical literature and the manufacturer and user facility device experience (MAUDE) database.,"Apr, 2008","OBJECTIVE: To summarize major complications and outcome for patients receiving percutaneous closure of atrial septal communications. DESIGN: The Medline database and the United States Food and Drug Administration manufacturer and user facility device experience databases (MAUDE) were searched for reports related to complications with atrial septal occluding devices. The medical literature documenting complication rates for these devices were reviewed and summarized. The MAUDE database complication reports were compared with those reported in the medical literature using national implant estimates. OUTCOME: The MAUDE database correlated in the type of complications most frequently encountered with each device. However, based on estimated total implant numbers, there is a higher incidence of major complications, including death. AGA devices had a 0.3% erosion/perforation rate with a higher morbidity and mortality (29%) than previously reported. NMT devices had a lower incidence of erosion/perforation rate of 0.05%. Embolization rates for the NMT devices were also lower than published European studies, possibly reflecting the US restriction of the device for closure of patent foramen ovale. Thrombus was more frequently encountered on the NMT device. Both AGA and NMT devices have been shown to be safe and effective alternatives to cardiac surgery. The MAUDE database correlated, with a very low overall complication rate, but showed a higher estimated major complication rate than the medical literature.

18372034,Bladder neck contractures related to the use of Hem-o-lok clips in robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.,"Mar, 2008","OBJECTIVE: Recently, several large series of robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) have described a low incidence of bladder neck contractures (BNC). We have had a similar experience at our institution. Our objective is to describe our experience with BNC after RALP and a novel relationship to the use of Hem-o-lok Clips (HOLC). METHODS: We reviewed a database of patients who underwent RALP at our institution from January 2004 to September 2007 and identified patients with BNC or complications related to the use of HOLC. We performed a retrospective chart review to attempt to determine the cause of each BNC. We also performed a PubMed search and review of the Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. RESULTS: Of 524 patients undergoing RALP, 4 had a BNC develop, 2 of the BNCs were associated with HOLC migration and erosion into the vesicourethral anastomosis, and 1 was found to have HOLC migration within the bladder. A fifth patient had an anastomotic leak develop secondary to a HOLC that migrated into the bladder neck. Two similar cases of HOLC-related migration have been reported to MAUDE. CONCLUSIONS: When early BNC or unexplained urinary retention occurs after RALP, one should have a high index of suspicion for migration of HOLC.

18323318,Epidural conduction device fractures and complications of retained fragments.,"Mar, 2008","During the past 3 years, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has received a growing number of adverse event reports on the breakage or fracturing and retention of anesthetic conduction device tips with associated complications. Serious injuries and other problems such as spinal stenosis, nerve root compression, and subcutaneous effusion can result. Several case reports demonstrate how the problems occur; some illustrate the severity of the problem. All cases are from adverse event reports in the FDA Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database. Frequently, in the interest of not causing patient harm, a device fragment might not be removed as long as the patient is not neurologically compromised or at risk for infection or there is little potential for migration of the fragmented piece.

18312981,A comprehensive review of suburethral sling procedure complications.,"Mar, 2008","The study objective was to review the existing literature regarding complications of anti-incontinence sling procedures. PubMed listings using keywords related to slings and associated complications with no date or language restrictions through May 2007 and the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database were searched for specific device- and procedure-related complications. Where no information was available, published abstracts were cited. Published reports of complications for all types of anti-incontinence sling procedures are analyzed and reported. Sling-related complications are multiple but can be summarized from studies on 13737 cumulative patients as involving: voiding dysfunction (8 studies, 881 patients, 16.3% average overall incidence [OI]); detrusor overactivity (20 studies, 1950 patients, 15.4% OI); urinary retention (14 studies, 943 patients, 14.2% OI); erosion/extrusion (19 studies, 2197 patients, 6.03% OI); impact on quality of life-dyspareunia (2 studies, 175 patients, 4.3% OI); infections-most often urinary tract infections but severe infections such as abscess are reported (19 studies, 1487 patients, 5.5% OI); hematoma-most often pelvic or vaginal (4 studies, 3691 patients, 2% OI); pain (6 studies, 597 patients, 7.3% OI); abdominal and pelvic organ injury-bladder, urethra, vagina, and intestines (10 studies, 1816 patients, 3.3% OI); systemic complications-deep vein thrombosis, sepsis (case reports); and death (case reports). Cure rates for all slings are as follows: subjective (16 studies, 1541 patients, 95% OI, range 63%-99%), objective (15 studies, 1203 patients, 82% OI, range 51%-97%), and failure (8 studies, 599 patients, 11.5% OI, range 4%-37%).

Several characteristics have been reported. This report evaluates retrievable filter designs in comparison with previously marketed designs with respect to efficacy and safety. Three inferior vena cava (IVC) filters (Gunther Tulip, Bard Recovery, and the Cordis OptEase) were compared on the basis of design characteristics associated with function, shape, number of trapping levels, and fixation. Adverse events reported in the literature and to the US Food and Drug Administration Manufacturers and User Facility Device Experience Database (MAUDE) were summarized. The major differences among device types include the fixation, the volume and number of trapping levels, and the amount of metal in the IVC. The MAUDE registry reported adverse events that had been hypothesized from the analysis of in vitro and in vivo testing. The Recovery and OptEase filters had the highest number of clinically important reports. From 12 to 57% were retrieved between 3 days and 11 months.

18304403,Device failures associated with patient injuries during robot-assisted laparoscopic surgeries: a comprehensive review of FDA MAUDE database.,"Feb, 2008","INTRODUCTION: Robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery has increased in the areas of cardiac and urologic surgery. We sought to determine the number of reported device malfunctions leading to patient injuries. METHODS: We performed a review of the MAUDE database of the FDA. Adverse events (AE) were defined as potential and actual product use errors and product quality problems. All incidents involving the ZEUS and da Vinci surgical robots were analyzed. RESULTS: The MAUDE database was last accessed on August 27, 2007. A total of 189 AEs were reported from 2000 to August 27, 2007. Assuming that 50,000 robotic-assisted laparoscopic cases have been performed, this represents 0.38% overall estimated failure rate. Twenty-one malfunctions were reported for the ZEUS robotic system between 2001 and 2003, while 168 malfunctions were reported for the da Vinci robotic system between 2000 and 2007. The rate of open conversions due to device malfunction decreased from 94% in 2003 to 16% in 2007. Of the 189 reported device malfunctions, only 9 (4.8%) were associated with patient injury. CONCLUSIONS: The increasing use of robotic-assisted surgery has led to an increase in the number of reported device malfunctions, albeit at a very small estimated rate of 0.38%.

PATIENTS: Retrospective review of electrode migration reported in association with the US Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database and a single-institution case series between 1996 and 2006. INTERVENTION: Cochlear implantation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Occurrence of electrode migration. RESULTS: During the period 1996 to 2006, 151 reports of electrode migration were filed in the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database. The most common association with migration was cochlear ossification, although 127 of 151 cases had no known association. During an equivalent period, 637 cochlear implant (CI) procedures were performed at the University of Miami. Of 580 primary CI operations, 2 cases of electrode migration were identified, both associated with reossification of a cochlea that was fully ossified at the first procedure.

METHODS: The Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database was retrospectively reviewed for reports dated from January 1992 to March 2006 using the key words ""nephrectomy"" and ""kidney."" All episodes of pure and hand-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy were evaluated. RESULTS: Of 2172 total nephrectomy or kidney-related reports, 352 reported failure using laparoscopic hemostatic devices to secure the renal vasculature, and 223 complications (63%) resulted during the use of endovascular stapling devices, 111 (33%) from nonlocking titanium clips and 18 (5%) from locking clips. The leading causes of failure reported in stapling devices were staple line malformation (47%) and locking up (29%). In titanium clips, jamming/feeding difficulties (27%) and trouble closing or ""scissoring"" clips (26%) were the most common. In locking clips, dislodgement (44%) was most frequently reported. Three, one, and three deaths were reported after the use of the stapling device, titanium clip, and locking clip device, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: All three methods used to secure the renal hilum in laparoscopic nephrectomy can result in malfunction. Because the overall denominator of use is not known, it would be inappropriate to conclude that one device is safer than another. When they occurred, these device malfunctions were potentially serious.

17575537,Endotherapy and surgery for GERD.,"Aug, 2007","Today, there are several modalities to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) (medications, endoscopic therapies, surgery) and such therapies can be used either singly, or in tandem, or in combination with the others, aiming at ""normalization"" of the patient's GERD-related quality of life and, if possible, esophageal acid exposure. Several intermediate end points or clinically significant outcomes have not been reached by some therapeutic modalities and no single modality is or can be perfect. Statistically significant improvements in these intermediate end points have been shown in ""some"" but not all studies. Although healing of esophagitis can be accomplished with either medical or surgical therapy, there is inadequate data with endotherapies, because most patients treated with endotherapies have had prior trials of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and hence healed their esophagitis. Effective prevention of complications, such as esophageal adenocarcinoma, remains challenging for all modalities. Patients who have not normalized their GERD-related quality of life with once or twice daily PPI therapy should undergo functional esophageal evaluation with pH testing and esophageal motility study and they should be evaluated by both an endoscopist and a surgeon. The decision on how to proceed should be made on the basis of the criteria for endotherapy and surgery, availability of local endoscopic and surgical expertise and patients' preference. Such multimodality therapy model is in many ways similar to the long-term management of coronary artery disease where pharmacotherapy, angioplasty, and bypass surgery are frequently used in tandem or in combination. Multimodality therapy aiming at normalization of GERD-related quality of life is an option today, and should be available to all patients in need of therapy. The target population for GERD endotherapy currently consists of PPI-dependent GERD patients, who have a small (<2-cm-long) or no sliding hiatal hernia, and without severe esophagitis or Barrett esophagus. Thus far, only Stretta and the NDO plicator have been studied in sham-controlled trials. Registries of complications suggest that these techniques are relatively safe, but serious morbidity, including rare mortality have been reported (for a continuous update on complications related to endoscopic therapies see: http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/maude.html). All can be performed on an outpatient basis, under intravenous sedation and local pharyngeal anesthesia.

17617499,Adverse events involving intravenous patient-controlled analgesia.,"Jul, 2007","PURPOSE: This article systematically characterizes aspects of all Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) reports associated with i.v. patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) postoperative use during a two-year index period. METHODS: Intravenous PCA represents a well-accepted and satisfactory means of acute pain treatment; case reports and large case series have described the occurrence of i.v. PCA-related adverse drug events (ADEs). MAUDE data files were downloaded, and all records pertaining to i.v. PCA devices were extracted for the two-year period from January 1, 2002, through December 31, 2003. Medical device events were categorized by their reported cause, including patient-related event, device safety event, operator error, and adverse reactions to opioids. Because there was not sufficient information to grade the certainty of each reported cause, all reported causes were graded ""possible,"" except for device safety events that were confirmed on inspection by the manufacturer. RESULTS: There were 2009 individual i.v. PCA-related MAUDE medical device events reported during the two-year period. Of these events, 1590 (79.1%) were classified as possible device safety events, 131 (6.5%) as possible operator error, 25 (1.2%) as possible adverse reactions to opioids, 12 (0.6%) as possible patient-related events, and 235 (11.7%) as indeterminate. CONCLUSION: Manufacturer-confirmed device malfunction was a major cause of reported ADE with i.v. PCA infusion pumps while operator errors were more likely to be associated with more serious adverse outcomes than device safety problems. To reduce the incidence of these problems, potential vulnerabilities in the design and manufacture of i.v.

RESULTS: The survival of 583 Sprint Fidelis 6949 leads implanted at our center between September 2004 and February 2007 was significantly less than 285 Sprint Quattro Secure model 6947 leads implanted by us between November 2001 and February 2007 (P = .005). Six patients presented with Sprint Fidelis lead failure 4-23 months after implant. Five of the six patients experienced multiple inappropriate shocks associated with pace-sense conductor and coil fractures; the sixth patient had a fixation mechanism failure. The MAUDE search rendered reports for 679 Sprint Fidelis leads. The most frequent complaints or observations were inappropriate shocks (33%), high impedance (33%), and fracture (35%). Of 125 leads analyzed by the manufacturer, 62 involved fracture of the pace-sense conductor or coil and the high-voltage (defibrillation) conductor. CONCLUSIONS: The Sprint Fidelis high-voltage lead appears to be prone to early failure. Its use should be limited until the failure mechanism is identified and corrected. Patients should be evaluated quarterly, and automatic lead test features should be enabled.

17197707,"Severe, diffuse coronary artery spasm after drug-eluting stent placement.","Jan, 2007","OBJECTIVES: Three cases of severe, diffuse coronary artery spasm after drug-eluting stent placement at our institution prompted this review. BACKGROUND: Drug-eluting stents have gained widespread use due to extraordinarily low rates of restenosis. Despite these generally superior clinical outcomes, the specter of rare idiosyncratic reactions remains a concern. METHODS: We performed searches of Medline and the U.S. FDA Manufacturer And User facility Device Experience database (MAUDE) to identify and describe spasm after coronary stent placement. Searches included drug-eluting and bare-metal stents. Institutional cases are reviewed. Location, time course and outcome of cases are described. RESULTS: Thirteen cases of spasm were identified after stent placement. Seven cases occurred after Cypher drug-eluting stent placement, 2 after Taxus drug-eluting stent placement, 1 after BiodivYsio and 3 after bare-metal stents. Five patients experienced diffuse, multivessel spasm--2 after Cypher, 2 after Taxus, and 1 after a Velocity stent. Of these 5 patients, 2 died. An additional 2 required intra-aortic balloon pump placement for cardiogenic shock. Another had persistent symptomatic, diffuse coronary spasm documented by angiography at 1 year.

17206901,Reported failures of the polymer self-locking (Hem-o-lok) clip: review of data from the Food and Drug Administration.,"Jan, 2007","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: New technology has played an important role in the proliferation of laparoscopy within urology. A central issue remains meticulous hemostasis, particularly for larger vessels (e.g., renal artery and vein). This paper presents available information regarding failure of the widely utilized nonabsorbable polymer Hem-o-lok clip (Weck Closure Systems, Research Triangle Park, NC), introduced in 1999. METHODS: The Food and Drug Administration Center for Devices and Radiological Health maintains a compendium of reports of adverse events involving medical devices (MAUDE). We performed multiple searches of MAUDE using a variety of key words, including Weck, Hem-o-lok, laparoscopy, nephrectomy, and clip. RESULTS: Within the MAUDE database, we identified 27 reports of problems with the Hem-o-lok clip until July 6, 2005. Of these events, only 1 (4%) involved application during open surgery, with the remainder occurring during laparoscopy. Minimal morbidity resulted from applicator difficulty during laparoscopic cholecystectomy (N = 7; 26%), with one case of open conversion. Forty-eight percent (N = 13) of the failures occurred during urologic laparoscopy; of these, bleeding was the primary problem in 77%. Delayed exploration, immediate open conversion, and death resulted in 38% (N = 5), 8% (N = 1), and 15% (N = 2), respectively. No clear etiology for the events could be found, although in all situations, multiple clips had been applied with apparent initial vessel control intraoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: Reported difficulty with the Hem-o-lok clip occurs primarily during laparoscopic surgery. Cases of failure after laparoscopic nephrectomy require urgent exploration, although it is unclear whether device or user error is the underlying cause. Regardless, care must be taken in securing the renal vessels, surgeons must be educated regarding proper use and techniques, and consideration should be given to using transfixing techniques.",No Full Text Available,reported failures of the polymer selflocking hemolok clip review of data from the food and drug administration,background and purpose new technology has played an important role in the proliferation of laparoscopy within urology a central issue remains meticulous hemostasis particularly for larger vessels eg renal artery and vein this paper presents available information regarding failure of the widely utilized nonabsorbable polymer hemolok clip weck closure systems research triangle park nc introduced in  methods the food and drug administration center for devices and radiological health maintains a compendium of reports of adverse events involving medical devices maude we performed multiple searches of maude using a variety of key words including weck hemolok laparoscopy nephrectomy and clip results within the maude database we identified  reports of problems with the hemolok clip until july   of these events only   involved application during open surgery with the remainder occurring during laparoscopy minimal morbidity resulted from applicator difficulty during laparoscopic cholecystectomy n    with one case of open conversion fortyeight percent n   of the failures occurred during urologic laparoscopy of these bleeding was the primary problem in  delayed exploration immediate open conversion and death resulted in  n    n   and  n   respectively no clear etiology for the events could be found although in all situations multiple clips had been applied with apparent initial vessel control intraoperatively conclusions reported difficulty with the hemolok clip occurs primarily during laparoscopic surgery cases of failure after laparoscopic nephrectomy require urgent exploration although it is unclear whether device or user error is the underlying cause regardless care must be taken in securing the renal vessels surgeons must be educated regarding proper use and techniques and consideration should be given to using transfixing techniques,reported failure polymer selflocking hemolok clip review data food drug administration background purpose new technology played important role proliferation laparoscopy within urology central issue remains meticulous hemostasis particularly larger vessel eg renal artery vein paper present available information regarding failure widely utilized nonabsorbable polymer hemolok clip weck closure system research triangle park nc introduced method food drug administration center device radiological health maintains compendium report adverse event involving medical device maude performed multiple search maude using variety key word including weck hemolok laparoscopy nephrectomy clip result within maude database identified report problem hemolok clip july event involved application open surgery remainder occurring laparoscopy minimal morbidity resulted applicator difficulty laparoscopic cholecystectomy n one case open conversion fortyeight percent n failure occurred urologic laparoscopy bleeding primary problem delayed exploration immediate open conversion death resulted n n n respectively clear etiology event could found although situation multiple clip applied apparent initial vessel control intraoperatively conclusion reported difficulty hemolok clip occurs primarily laparoscopic surgery case failure laparoscopic nephrectomy require urgent exploration although unclear whether device user error underlying cause regardless care must taken securing renal vessel surgeon must educated regarding proper use technique consideration given using transfixing technique,Uncertain
17149713,Presentation and management of major complications of midurethral slings: Are complications under-reported?,"Dec, 2006","AIMS: Midurethral slings have become the mainstay of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) treatment due to their efficacy and low complication rates. The purpose of this study was to report the presentation and treatment of major complications from these minimally invasive treatments presented to a tertiary referral practice and to highlight a discrepancy in major complications between literature and the food and drug administration (FDA) device failure database. METHODS: From 2001 through 2005, we reviewed all cases of midurethral sling complications that presented to our institution. A literature review of all complications due to midurethral slings during the same time period was performed as was the FDA manufacturer and user facility device experience (MAUDE) database queried for self-reported complications. RESULTS: A total of 26 patients referred to UCLA with voiding dysfunction after sling placement was found to have mesh in the urethra or bladder. Treatments required a combination of urethrolysis with mesh removal, urethral reconstruction with graft, and bladder excision. These were compared to major complications reported in the world literature of <1%. The MAUDE database contained 161 major complications out of a total of 928 complications reported for suburethral slings. There was significantly more major complications reported in MAUDE than in published literature. CONCLUSIONS: Although rare, major complications of midurethral slings are more common than appear in literature.

16769279,Emerging endoluminal therapies for gastroesophageal reflux disease: adverse events.,"Jun, 2006","BACKGROUND: Endoluminal therapies are emerging as a new therapeutic option for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Many of these endoluminal therapies are touted as short outpatient procedures with minimal complications. It is thought that these complications are uncommon and minor. This investigation sought to summarize the adverse events of these endoluminal therapies for the treatment of GERD. METHODS: The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Center for Devices and Radiological Health Web site was searched to examine all voluntary adverse events reported on emerging endoluminal therapies. The adverse events can be divided into 3 categories: (1) radiofrequency ablation based, (2) injection based, and (3) suture based. RESULTS: There were a total of 50 adverse events reported on 4 specific therapies. Half of the complications were found to result from injection-based therapy and 44% of the complications were found to result from radiofrequency ablation-based therapy. There were 8 deaths reported (5 in the injection-based group and 3 in the radiofrequency ablation-based group). Sixty-four percent of the adverse events resulted in hospitalizations and 10% of these patients required surgery.

16036187,Trocar-associated injuries and fatalities: an analysis of 1399 reports to the FDA.,"Jul, 2005","Laparoscopic trocars, medical devices used to gain access into the abdominal cavity, are the most common device named in malpractice injury claims associated with laparoscopic procedures. As part of its ongoing adverse event reporting program, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires manufacturers and user facilities to file a report whenever a device was or may have been a factor in a death or serious injury. The FDA collects data from these reports in its Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. This study presents an analysis of fatality and injury data on laparoscopic trocars found in MAUDE reports received from January 1, 1997, through June 30, 2002, including 31 fatal injury cases and 1353 reports on nonfatal injuries. Cholecystectomy was the procedure most frequently associated with both fatal and nonfatal trocar injuries. Most fatalities involved vascular injuries. All fatality reports that identified the trocar design involved either a shielded trocar (which has a retractable shield that covers the trocar blade before and after insertion to help protect abdominal and pelvic organs from inadvertent puncture) or an optical trocar (which allows laparoscopists to view the cutting tip as it penetrates the tissues). Narrative comments cited surgical technique, device problems, and patient characteristics as contributing factors. Among nonfatal injuries, a change in surgical management such as additional surgical procedure--primarily laparotomy--prolonged surgery, or aborted surgery was reported most frequently for vascular and hollow viscus injuries. Many reports did not identify the device model, surgical procedure, or event timing, limiting Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and manufacturer investigations into whether the device contributed to the event. The most common manufacturer conclusions indicated the trocar was not returned, and no conclusions could be drawn about the trocar's contribution to the event. Fatalities occur with procedures in which shielded trocars and optical trocars are used. Further study is needed to evaluate the high proportion of reports associated with laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Laparoscopists should retain for evaluation any devices implicated in patient injuries and should ensure that detailed information on adverse events is provided in adverse event reports to the FDA. The FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database can be a valuable source for information on adverse outcomes associated with medical devices and, given an understanding of its limitation, provides researchers with a viable adjunct to published literature and litigation surveys for obtaining this information.",No Full Text Available,trocarassociated injuries and

15805456,Do split-side rails present an increased risk to patient safety?,"Apr, 2005","BACKGROUND: Concerns have been raised about the safety of split-side bed rails for patients in the UK. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether split-side rails were more likely to be associated with entrapment and injury of patients than other bed rail types. To establish whether there was a difference in the site of injury caused by different bed rail types and whether the outcome of the injury (death versus survival) varied by bedrail type. METHODS: A search of the USA Food and Drug Administration MAUDE database was carried out. The reports were screened using rigorous inclusion/exclusion criteria and then coded for rail type, incident outcome, and area of body involved. RESULTS: Split-side rail incidents only accounted for 5% of the reports and were more likely to involve the chest or pelvis. Although the biggest overall risk by rail type cannot be determined from these data, the severity of the outcome changed with the equipment type. Incidents involving half rails were more likely to be associated with head, neck, or face entrapments and were also more likely than other bed rail types to result in death. DISCUSSION: Split-side rail entrapments were not a common occurrence. However, our findings suggest that bed rails are associated with some level of risk of entrapment that potentially could result in death. Healthcare providers should therefore ensure that they follow the guidelines for risk assessment and rail use from the MHRA and other professional bodies so that the cultural norm in the UK continues to be ""opt in"", where no bed rails are used unless indicated by a documented clinical assessment.",No Full Text Available,do splitside rails present an increased risk to patient safety,background concerns have been raised about the safety of splitside bed rails for patients in the uk objectives to investigate whether splitside rails were more likely to be associated with entrapment and injury of patients than other bed rail types to establish whether there was a difference in the site of injury caused by different bed rail types and whether the outcome of the injury death versus survival varied by bedrail type methods a search of the usa food and drug administration maude database was carried out the reports were screened using rigorous inclusionexclusion criteria and then coded for rail type incident outcome and area of body involved results splitside rail incidents only accounted for  of the reports and were more likely to involve the chest or pelvis although the biggest overall risk by rail type cannot be determined from these data the severity of the outcome changed with the equipment type incidents involving half rails were more likely to be associated with head neck or face entrapments and were also more likely than other bed rail types to result in death discussion splitside rail entrapments were not a common occurrence however our findings suggest that bed rails are associated with some level of risk of entrapment that potentially could result in death healthcare providers should therefore ensure that they follow the guidelines for risk assessment and rail use from the mhra and other professional bodies so that the cultural norm in the uk continues to be opt in where no bed rails are used unless indicated by a documented clinical assessment,splitside rail present increased risk patient safety background concern raised safety splitside bed rail patient uk objective investigate whether splitside rail likely associated entrapment injury patient bed rail type establish whether difference site injury caused different bed rail type whether outcome injury death versus survival varied bedrail type method search usa food drug administration maude database carried report screened using rigorous inclusionexclusion criterion coded rail type incident outcome area body involved result splitside rail incident accounted report likely involve chest pelvis although biggest overall risk rail type determined data severity outcome changed equipment type incident involving half rail likely associated head neck face entrapment also likely bed rail type result death discussion splitside rail entrapment common occurrence however finding suggest bed rail associated level risk entrapment potentially could result death healthcare provider therefore ensure follow guideline risk assessment rail use mhra professional body cultural norm uk continues opt bed rail used unless indicated documented clinical assessment,Medical Device Safety Incidents
15781766,Cochlear implant complications: utility of federal database in systematic analysis.,"Mar, 2005","OBJECTIVES: To explore the suitability of the Manufacturer User Facility and Distributor Experience (MAUDE) database (which is maintained by the Food and Drug Administration and has a mandatory reporting requirement) for systemic analysis of cochlear implant complications and treatments and, in so doing, analyze trends in cochlear implant complications for 2 periods, 2002 and pre-1998. DATA SOURCES: All events from 2002 and from before 1998 were considered. Events and action taken were categorized and tabulated. DATA SYNTHESIS: Because there was no null hypothesis, statistical analysis (chi2) was only used in comparing the 2 time frames. CONCLUSIONS: Structural limitations of the database, in addition to disparate reporting quality, made systematic analysis difficult. It was noted that spontaneous device failure accounted for the greatest single number of adverse events for both 2002 and the pre-1998 period (267/654 [41%] and 74/129 [57%], respectively), confirming earlier studies. A statistically significant decrease in spontaneous device failure and a significant increase in infections from the pre-1998 period to 2002 was observed. Flap problems ranging from extrusion to infection that required explantation were less frequently reimplanted than other problems requiring explantation, such as device failure or trauma. We considered new directions, including close collaboration with the new MedSun reporting system and conclude that while a valuable resource for narrative data, the current structure of the MAUDE database is only modestly useful for analyzing trends in complications and cannot answer several crucial questions, including device type comparisons.

Moreover we analyzed the procedure outcomes in terms of stent position inside the patient's body and the possible therapies adopted to solve the problems. The results showed that the most probable event that can lead to an accident is the stent separation from the balloon which, alone, turns up in a number of cases equal to the sum of all the others.

Hyalgan (sodium hyaluronate), Supartz (sodium hyaluronate), and Synvisc (hylan G-F 20) are Food and Drug Administration-approved HA products. They are derived from rooster combs; Hyalgan and Supartz are naturally derived (unmodified); Synvisc is chemically modified to increase its molecular weight. This article reviews and updates the safety data for IA HAs used for the treatment of knee OA. METHODS: References were taken from Medline through July 2002; respective product information services and information from the searchable United States Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database also were used. RESULTS: All products demonstrated favorable safety profiles in clinical trials and practice compared to other standard therapies for management of OA knee pain. The most common adverse event associated with HAs is mild injection site pain and swelling. Each product has had rare reports of pseudogout and anaphylactoid reactions. Product-specific adverse events, severe acute inflammatory reactions (pseudoseptic knee), in patients receiving Synvisc have been reported. One such patient developed antibodies to chicken proteins and hylan, suggesting an immunologic basis for the severe acute inflammatory reaction.

11475818,Unexpected ICD pulse generator failure due to electronic circuit damage caused by electrical overstress.,"Jul, 2001","Because it is a lifesaving device, the unexpected failure of an ICD can be catastrophic. We report ICD electronic circuit failure due to electrical overstress damage (EOS) to the high voltage hybird circuit and other electronic components in a series of ICD pulse generator models. Data were obtained from the Multicenter Registry of Pacemaker and ICD Pacemaker and Lead Failures, and from the manufactures' adverse event reports, that were in the FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. Of 16 nonbattery Guidant/CPI ICD pulse generator failures reported to the registry, 6 (38%) have been confirmed by the manufacturer to be EOS related, and Guidant/CPI has reported 273 such failures to the FDA as of 12/29/00. The signs of failure included loss of telemetry and inability to deliver therapy, and some patients have experienced serious adverse events.

11243287,Impact of FDA advisory on reported vacuum-assisted delivery and morbidity.,"Mar, 2001","OBJECTIVE: In May 1998 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a health advisory reporting neonatal injuries/deaths following vacuum delivery and encouraged voluntary reports of future adverse events. We compared FDA reports of vacuum delivery adverse events prior to and following the advisory. METHODS: The FDA database (MAUDE) was searched for vacuum deliveries using brand name, manufacturer name, and procedure ""string searches."" Cases were sorted by report date, source, and manufacturer. Neonatal morbidity was quantified as deaths and life-threatening or nonlife-threatening events. RESULTS: A total of 80 reported adverse cases were identified after duplicate cases were consolidated. Twenty-five were reported to the FDA prior to the 1998 advisory and 55 in the immediate 6-month period following the advisory. There was a 22-fold increase in reported events from five events/year prior to the advisory to an estimated 110 events/year following the advisory. The distribution of reporting sources changed significantly following the advisory with increased ""manufacturer"" (8-43%) and decreased ""voluntary"" reports (56-20%). All major brand names were represented. During the 6 months following the FDA advisory there were 10 neonatal deaths, 30 life-threatening events, 12 nonlife-threatening events, and three equipment-related reports. Infant deaths were due to intracranial or subgaleal hematomas. Injuries included skull fracture, scalp abrasions, and cephalohematomas. CONCLUSIONS: The FDA advisory was associated with a 22-fold increase in the rate of reported adverse events. This increase in reporting likely represents both enhanced awareness of complications as well as an increase in vacuum-related adverse neonatal sequelae. As vacuum delivery is associated with greater neonatal morbidity/ mortality than was previously recognized, the adage that the vacuum is ""designed to come off before infant damage occurs"" appears unsubstantiated. It is recommended that manufacturers quantify the suction and traction capabilities of present and new proposed vacuum cup designs.",No Full Text Available,impact of fda advisory on reported vacuumassisted delivery and morbidity,objective in may  the us food and drug administration fda issued a health advisory reporting neonatal injuriesdeaths following vacuum delivery and encouraged voluntary reports of future adverse events we compared fda reports of vacuum delivery adverse events prior to and following the advisory methods the fda database maude was searched for vacuum deliveries using brand name manufacturer name and procedure string searches cases were sorted by report date source and manufacturer neonatal morbidity was quantified as deaths and lifethreatening or nonlifethreatening events results a total of  reported adverse cases were identified after duplicate cases were consolidated twentyfive were reported to the fda prior to the  advisory and  in the immediate month period following the advisory there was a fold increase in reported events from five eventsyear prior to the advisory to an estimated  eventsyear following the advisory the distribution of reporting sources changed significantly following the advisory with increased manufacturer  and decreased voluntary reports  all major brand names were represented during the  months following the fda advisory there were  neonatal deaths  lifethreatening events  nonlifethreatening events and three equipmentrelated reports infant deaths were due to intracranial or subgaleal hematomas injuries included skull fracture scalp abrasions and cephalohematomas conclusions the fda advisory was associated with a fold increase in the rate of reported adverse events this increase in reporting likely represents both enhanced awareness of complications as well as an increase in vacuumrelated adverse neonatal sequelae as vacuum delivery is associated with greater neonatal morbidity mortality than was previously recognized the adage that the vacuum is designed to come off before infant damage occurs appears unsubstantiated it is recommended that manufacturers quantify the suction and traction capabilities of present and new proposed vacuum cup designs,impact fda advisory reported vacuumassisted delivery morbidity objective may u food drug administration fda issued health advisory reporting neonatal injuriesdeaths following vacuum delivery encouraged voluntary report future adverse event compared fda report vacuum delivery adverse event prior following advisory method fda database maude searched vacuum delivery using brand name manufacturer name procedure string search case sorted report date source manufacturer neonatal morbidity quantified death lifethreatening nonlifethreatening event result total reported adverse case identified duplicate case consolidated twentyfive reported fda prior advisory immediate month period following advisory fold increase reported event five eventsyear prior advisory estimated eventsyear following advisory distribution reporting source changed significantly following advisory increased manufacturer decreased voluntary report major brand name represented month following fda advisory neonatal death lifethreatening event nonlifethreatening event three equipmentrelated report infant death due intracranial subgaleal hematoma injury included skull fracture scalp abrasion cephalohematoma conclusion fda advisory associated fold increase rate reported adverse event increase reporting likely represents enhanced awareness complication well increase vacuumrelated adverse neonatal sequela vacuum delivery associated greater neonatal morbidity mortality previously recognized adage vacuum designed come infant damage occurs appears unsubstantiated recommended manufacturer quantify suction traction capability present new proposed vacuum cup design,Uncertain

21249841,Evaluating and Predicting Patient Safety for Medical Devices with Integral Information Technology,,"Human errors in medical device use account for a large portion of medical errors. Most of these errors are due to inappropriate designs for user interactions, rather than mechanical failures. Evaluating and predicting patient safety in medical device use is critical for developing interventions to reduce such errors either by redesigning the devices or, if redesign is not an option, by training the users on the identified trouble spots in the devices. We developed two methods for evaluating and predicting patient safety in medical devices with integral information technology, then applied and tested them on several infusion pumps. The first method is a modified discount-usability method called heuristic evaluation. The method was used to evaluate and compare the safety of two 1-channel volumetric infusion pumps. The results show that heuristic evaluation, when modified for medical devices, is a useful, efficient, and low-cost method for evaluating patient safety features of medical devices through the identification of usability problems and their severities. The second method is an extended hierarchical task analysis (EHTA), devised to predict medical errors in medical device use. EHTA divides the task space between the external world of the device interface and the internal cognitive world of the user, allowing for descriptive predictions of potential user errors at the human device level. Its use is demonstrated in the analysis of two infusion pumps. The estimates of the likelihood of user errors with the two pumps are consistent with the corresponding reported use errors in the Federal Drug Administration (FDA)'s Manufacturer and User Device Experience (MAUDE) database, thus demonstrating the usefulness of this tool for predicting medical device use errors.",No Full Text Available,evaluating and predicting patient safety for medical devices with integral information technology,human errors in medical device use account for a large portion of medical errors most of these errors are due to inappropriate designs for user interactions rather than mechanical failures evaluating and predicting patient safety in medical device use is critical for developing interventions to reduce such errors either by redesigning the devices or if redesign is not an option by training the users on the identified trouble spots in the devices we developed two methods for evaluating and predicting patient safety in medical devices with integral information technology then applied and tested them on several infusion pumps the first method is a modified discountusability method called heuristic evaluation the method was used to evaluate and compare the safety of two channel volumetric infusion pumps the results show that heuristic evaluation when modified for medical devices is a useful efficient and lowcost method for evaluating patient safety features of medical devices through the identification of usability problems and their severities the second method is an extended hierarchical task analysis ehta devised to predict medical errors in medical device use ehta divides the task space between the external world of the device interface and the internal cognitive world of the user allowing for descriptive predictions of potential user errors at the human device level its use is demonstrated in the analysis of two infusion pumps the estimates of the likelihood of user errors with the two pumps are consistent with the corresponding reported use errors in the federal drug administration fdas manufacturer and user device experience maude database thus demonstrating the usefulness of this tool for predicting medical device use errors,evaluating predicting patient safety medical device integral information technology human error medical device use account large portion medical error error due inappropriate design user interaction rather mechanical failure evaluating predicting patient safety medical device use critical developing intervention reduce error either redesigning device redesign option training user identified trouble spot device developed two method evaluating predicting patient safety medical device integral information technology applied tested several infusion pump first method modified discountusability method called heuristic evaluation method used evaluate compare safety two channel volumetric infusion pump result show heuristic evaluation modified medical device useful efficient lowcost method evaluating patient safety feature medical device identification usability problem severity second method extended hierarchical task analysis ehta devised predict medical error medical device use ehta divide task space external world device interface internal cognitive world user allowing descriptive prediction potential user error human device level use demonstrated analysis two infusion pump estimate likelihood user error two pump consistent corresponding reported use error federal drug administration fda manufacturer user device experience maude database thus demonstrating usefulness tool predicting medical device use error,Medical Device Safety Incidents
